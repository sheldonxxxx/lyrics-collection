[0.38s -> 2.30s]  Flutter fluttering, hover hovering
[3.40s -> 5.74s]  Call is calling for me, blossoms in a spree
[6.11s -> 8.66s]  Flower down I see in my memory
[8.66s -> 11.56s]  Waves my soul from the sky
[19.02s -> 21.96s]  Could not foresee in what they trod
[21.96s -> 24.80s]  I was brought into a place unsigned
[25.74s -> 28.02s]  Distances so far out of my sight
[30.00s -> 30.96s]  Shine it bright
[32.00s -> 34.66s]  Have to feel the sparkle running inside
[34.66s -> 37.76s]  As stars divide, then visions open
[37.76s -> 40.58s]  One dream view, a world that is so vibrant
[40.58s -> 43.07s]  Each time you give me hopeless challenges
[44.68s -> 47.66s]  I'm suspected the answer is on
[47.66s -> 50.02s]  And what's unknown, but I'll find it
[50.32s -> 52.06s]  Oh trust me, I'll close it on
[52.06s -> 53.56s]  The end beyond that road
[53.56s -> 56.30s]  I'm bound to see a brand new sea
[56.30s -> 58.14s]  Past all lingering dead
[107.20s -> 109.08s]  I'm in this very place,
[109.12s -> 111.34s]  I've been so close to these feelings
[111.52s -> 113.46s]  All the sadness and bad joy
[113.46s -> 117.14s]  And all the people's emotions are touching my soul
[117.14s -> 118.85s]  It's waste with the truth
[122.00s -> 124.20s]  Have to feel the sparkle rushing inside
[124.56s -> 127.36s]  I stop, divide, then visions open
[127.36s -> 130.16s]  When I'm in a world that is so vibrant
[130.16s -> 132.66s]  Each day you give me hopeless challenges
[135.42s -> 138.66s]  Unsuspecting the answer is only what I know
[138.71s -> 140.65s]  But I'll find it, oh trust me
[140.70s -> 143.14s]  I close in on the end, beyond that road
[143.14s -> 145.92s]  I'm bound to see a brand new me
[147.14s -> 151.00s]  I'm lingering doubt, alone, couldn't guess
[151.58s -> 153.52s]  Never thought back in those days
[153.52s -> 155.86s]  The future that has started blooming today
[155.86s -> 158.74s]  I wouldn't mind a time like this
[158.74s -> 160.50s]  I can't really complain
[166.36s -> 169.02s]  Flutter fluttery, hover hovery
[169.90s -> 172.00s]  Cycle to restart, year end and apart
[172.88s -> 175.24s]  So the wind may stray, let your body sway
[177.14s -> 177.84s]  Dance with me
