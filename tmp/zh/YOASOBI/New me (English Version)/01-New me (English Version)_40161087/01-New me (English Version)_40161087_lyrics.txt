1.I keep on living for that day-to-day, so plain and flat
2.Until a change came to me that fateful day
3.Now here’s the story
4.And as the tale unfolds
5.I know I will be growing closer than all my thoughts could hold
6.To turning into that New Me7.
8.Hands down, got better with my smile
9.And pleasant side, I put on day by day
10.But now, I’m worn out
11.My true self is nowhere to be found
12.Faking that “I’m feeling good”
13.And lying that “I’m feeling you”
14.Cannot take any more15.
16.Hey you, are you dating now?
17.So, just give it a go
18.Not this again…
19.Bad day
20.Bad things
21.My boss
22.Uh, oh…
23.I hate him so much, and I don’t want us talking
24.Heavy heart, but I thought that I had to try
25.I promised that I would
26.So it led up to that day I’ve met you27.
28.Marching into the wild at morn in that station
29.I make a thoughtful choice
30.And I dress nice but not special
31.The clear joy coming from your voice as you call out my name
32.It makes me rejoice
33.My face rising bright34.
35.I’ve met the unknown
36.I don’t know what you mean at all
37.Oh, I’ve met the unknown
38.Rolling in with the bangs you show
39.I’ve met the unknown
40.I’ve met him, he’s mysterious
41.Never thought that encounter would be the sudden start of that story42.
43.Newly met up this way
44.The greetings are done, and now, it’s unfolding in no time
45.Dash in the wind
46.We’re leaving behind the rhythm of days full of routines
47.It’s just me and you
48.We break through city views49.
50.So, I’ve met the unknown
51.I don’t know what you mean at all
52.Oh, I’ve met the unknown
53.With that oversized shirt you wore
54.I’ve met the unknown
55.Don’t know what path I’d call my own
56.This turn of fate is hard to conceive
57.And though…58.
59.The feelings you gave me now
60.This day of new sights you’ve bestowed
61.They have gotten through to my heart
62.And they have made me realize
63.What I’ve always kept on hating inside me must have been the face I’ve put on
64.And the self I’ve been all that while65.
66.Time for me to seize that new future, take off
67.And break apart my former self till none of it is left
68.Uh, oh…
69.Don’t mind what type of days come
70.I’ll be me, living as me and not undergo
71.Because it’s what I chose72.
73.I’ve met the unknown
74.Unlocking doors all of my own
75.Oh, I’ll meet new unknowns
76.The routine of today
77.And all the days that show up dry and dull are about to be over
78.No looking back because today is the start of my brand new way
79.Beginning now, it’s my own story
