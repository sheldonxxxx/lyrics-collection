[4.06s -> 7.30s]  Here I make new meaning over these waters
[8.21s -> 12.33s]  Consumed and cut the clear with a scissor
[12.42s -> 18.08s]  Two flippin' wings as fast as I can take To my city,
[18.16s -> 21.80s]  there it's go soon beyond this ocean
[21.80s -> 25.44s]  Yes, I'm a small little swallow arriving
[26.98s -> 30.20s]  Upon a city there is something that I saw
[31.49s -> 34.67s]  That's full of joy, I hear a few voices
[34.68s -> 39.90s]  And sounds of worry and sorrow of other friends' voices
[39.90s -> 45.06s]  We all have many different ways to be little as we are
[45.06s -> 49.84s]  And wanted to just protect without a type of notice
[51.80s -> 54.24s]  We reflect the despite on one another
[54.78s -> 57.30s]  Under the same sky we're livin'
[58.72s -> 59.62s]  Brought to the world,
[60.20s -> 62.30s]  every tone is more than naught
[62.66s -> 64.77s]  Many lives of color, variety
[64.80s -> 67.49s]  Together we keep livin'
[67.84s -> 68.74s]  With everyone,
[69.26s -> 71.36s]  we people and all the plant
[71.36s -> 74.56s]  Every fruit and flower, shorter to shorter
[74.56s -> 75.88s]  Just look around
[77.24s -> 77.98s]  But in the world,
[78.46s -> 80.46s]  things we're always reaching for
[81.80s -> 86.00s]  The futures we're looking for are all such different tones
[86.00s -> 89.72s]  If we're able to keep going hand in hand
[89.72s -> 94.30s]  We will be happy and living together with a smile
[94.30s -> 98.98s]  I'm thinking of what I can do to make it better now
[115.40s -> 118.48s]  Back on the other side of fortune
[118.48s -> 120.68s]  That's taken up by somebody
[120.68s -> 123.04s]  Friends have lost location
[123.04s -> 125.58s]  A place to live and come home to
[125.58s -> 127.60s]  Only thing he wanted
[127.60s -> 129.52s]  Was to harmoniously
[129.52s -> 133.10s]  Be living here together in just me
[134.06s -> 136.16s]  Could not see anything
[136.98s -> 138.64s]  Overtaken by sorrow
[138.75s -> 141.04s]  Shadows almost here to stay
[141.80s -> 147.66s]  colors in my soul When you start to forget and accept our differences
[148.03s -> 151.28s]  We begin to make connection once again
[152.58s -> 155.40s]  What could it be that we can be doing
[155.40s -> 159.08s]  now Even if we couldn't change it all
[159.08s -> 165.09s]  By doing everything we can let it be known To somebody's vagal home
[165.22s -> 169.90s]  Bring a little bit of vibrancy in color to their world
[171.80s -> 174.30s]  Far from a precious source of life
[175.16s -> 178.88s]  It's nothing like anybody's shit or gold
[178.88s -> 181.02s]  But just as hell we see
[181.18s -> 183.52s]  If we could make our world
[183.52s -> 184.10s]  Start
[184.99s -> 188.04s]  overflowing with a subtle little piece of love
[188.04s -> 190.00s]  Take notice what's around
[190.02s -> 192.48s]  Some changes you will see
[192.56s -> 197.06s]  Under the same sky we'll let it one day it'll show
[197.06s -> 200.26s]  So goes the story of small and little
[202.30s -> 204.10s]  Me holding a big dream
