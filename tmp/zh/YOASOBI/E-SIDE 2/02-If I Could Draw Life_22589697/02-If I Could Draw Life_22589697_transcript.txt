[4.58s -> 7.52s]  To see how that moon is shining beauty
[9.62s -> 11.59s]  While I'm all by myself surrounded
[12.58s -> 13.16s]  by trees
[14.40s -> 17.42s]  On the edge of departure to be started my journey
[19.28s -> 22.70s]  After that day, relevance came across my view
[24.06s -> 25.34s]  Fearless as that we have,
[25.42s -> 27.70s]  however all this kindness is for me
[27.70s -> 30.60s]  My mouth is on the sketching now I'm throwing on paint and all
[30.60s -> 33.46s]  I love a ship was that was carrying I was strong so we could
[33.46s -> 35.06s]  I'm gonna leave a ship get outdry my way
[35.06s -> 37.86s]  Went to work I said I made this one to come though that we parted
[37.86s -> 41.30s]  Then we came to meet and it's such a time falling for you
[41.30s -> 42.68s]  I learned I fell in love
[42.68s -> 45.40s]  See I was feeling that joy was bound to be so
[45.40s -> 49.06s]  Said why I said that all I'm treasuring has been faded too
[49.06s -> 52.98s]  And in a growl a realm of gathering walls
[52.98s -> 55.01s]  I can't leave my store
[55.52s -> 57.63s]  I need to pull a beat up with a straight eye
[57.76s -> 59.65s]  But sitting up the way you never meant
[59.82s -> 61.92s]  Heart is with you, forgive me
[62.08s -> 64.04s]  All I want is to hurt your bones and it cut me off
[64.04s -> 68.16s]  So I can't stand everything that that's how I was to be the bad one
[69.04s -> 73.02s]  Can't anymore, I got a people as you know
[73.02s -> 74.52s]  All night's fooling me
[74.52s -> 76.56s]  La la la la la la la oh
[76.56s -> 78.98s]  La la la la la la la oh
[78.98s -> 81.36s]  La la la la la la la oh
[81.94s -> 84.20s]  And I could not reach for that sight
[84.20s -> 85.54s]  I failed to end my bond
[85.54s -> 86.60s]  The grind has been surprising
[88.04s -> 89.08s]  The much act that with me
[89.08s -> 90.04s]  I tap every time
[90.04s -> 91.00s]  Give me a Mr. Guy
[91.00s -> 92.70s]  And telling powers crept out
[92.70s -> 95.26s]  I pour life into things I see and draw
[95.26s -> 97.36s]  As I distribute with this power
[97.42s -> 99.06s]  Even though the dying green arrows
[99.06s -> 100.30s]  Darned all the access to
[100.30s -> 102.16s]  And I could give her this time that I hold
[102.16s -> 103.50s]  And I'm ready for love
[104.52s -> 107.90s]  The life of a sendro is more pieces than anybody that ends up
[108.46s -> 110.26s]  Then I found a meaning to my life
[110.30s -> 112.26s]  So was everything when I got to meet ya
[112.34s -> 115.72s]  Resembling me you had been all better days living in the walls
[115.72s -> 118.92s]  And when I tried to leave before an end in my own cup
[118.92s -> 121.68s]  Man I'm in the middle of a night I was miss my life
[121.68s -> 125.10s]  But I know you already have somebody who's so dear to you
[125.10s -> 126.96s]  He went on and betrayed you and you know it's wrong
[126.96s -> 129.36s]  And even so to reside inside your love for him flows
[129.36s -> 132.24s]  So now he's on a way to a fate out life to lose all use
[132.24s -> 134.98s]  You kept on crying and it was his name you called
[136.60s -> 139.52s]  It took the sight of you to make me realize
[139.54s -> 142.06s]  I need a single day
[142.06s -> 143.82s]  So call me dead
[143.82s -> 145.48s]  All the soul to draw into
[145.48s -> 146.94s]  Burn in my life
[146.94s -> 148.98s]  In what I sketched out
[150.08s -> 150.78s]  And from there
[152.06s -> 154.06s]  Wraiths float up in an ice
[154.06s -> 156.20s]  I made it happen, it's a miracle, baby
[156.20s -> 158.26s]  As you were shedding tears coming from your glass
[158.26s -> 160.08s]  Foolish, wearing no trial
[160.08s -> 161.56s]  To have you know in my thought
[162.18s -> 162.70s]  Listen,
[162.88s -> 163.96s]  in that way,
[164.02s -> 165.96s]  giving me the joy to live my life again
[165.96s -> 167.03s]  I'm waiting for you, I
[167.62s -> 170.18s]  so truly have love for you
[170.18s -> 172.72s]  Deep inside, I feel your goodbye
[172.72s -> 175.14s]  La la la la la la la la oh oh
[175.30s -> 177.54s]  La la la la la la la oh oh
[177.70s -> 179.87s]  La la la la la la la oh oh
[180.90s -> 183.30s]  And in that chest, me, I stand between you
[183.30s -> 184.68s]  My mom has seen my thoughts,
[184.80s -> 185.84s]  what's in game has built
[185.84s -> 189.54s]  And slowly closing my eyes end up the line of such a long journey
[189.54s -> 191.92s]  Finally united again
