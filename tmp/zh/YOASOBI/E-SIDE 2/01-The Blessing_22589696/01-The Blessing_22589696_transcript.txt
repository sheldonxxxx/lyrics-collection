[0.00s -> 3.34s]  I see you're now thinking of the stars so remote
[3.34s -> 6.28s]  You're dowsing off to be living through with a thought
[6.28s -> 8.96s]  And if you tell you decide the way you want you try
[8.96s -> 10.44s]  Wherever you choose to stay,
[10.54s -> 12.36s]  off to go together I'll be there
[23.90s -> 27.40s]  You hold all memories asleep in you
[27.68s -> 33.06s]  You then were taken apart so young to this star deep inside
[33.06s -> 36.10s]  The growing wish had to die over there
[36.10s -> 38.62s]  A scenery that glittered
[39.46s -> 44.66s]  If you could only jump and land in the glow of your time
[44.80s -> 47.06s]  It's only you so lonely in this moment
[47.06s -> 49.28s]  In broken desire, dreaming hope
[49.28s -> 51.32s]  You're drawing as you see the future
[51.32s -> 53.48s]  And if you choose to keep on marching on
[53.48s -> 56.46s]  Instead of burning up and clear it up and it out
[57.40s -> 60.44s]  But I've done images of one thing that I'm not seeing
[60.44s -> 62.58s]  That's a chosen by someone else
[62.58s -> 64.90s]  You and I, and I, delete our story
[65.38s -> 68.22s]  We never let you be alone and be gone from your sight
[68.22s -> 69.56s]  Hidden out in your truth,
[69.78s -> 70.98s]  where did it all come from?
[71.10s -> 73.86s]  We all play to be caught in all those chains and boundaries
[74.40s -> 76.10s]  Chains at all times,
[76.18s -> 77.74s]  together we'll be fighting on
[87.40s -> 88.92s]  But I think it's pretty amazing
[89.28s -> 90.62s]  Go ahead and crash it,
[90.70s -> 91.22s]  break it,
[91.32s -> 92.72s]  ruin it all with some purpose
[92.72s -> 94.18s]  If that would be your ending,
[94.38s -> 94.59s]  nice,
[94.72s -> 96.29s]  now your future's to shine bright
[96.30s -> 96.84s]  I'm done,
[96.92s -> 97.28s]  possibilities,
[97.58s -> 98.72s]  make it what you want to
[98.72s -> 102.18s]  As two schools fall in a pass, you ran after me
[102.18s -> 105.00s]  Saw you climb up in a cockpit and stand inside
[105.00s -> 107.68s]  The kid in six left in the past, no more to cry
[107.68s -> 110.08s]  Before I realized you grew to be powerful
[112.19s -> 114.54s]  It's your life, you're so real, wait
[117.50s -> 120.58s]  And it has no answer that is right
[123.80s -> 125.72s]  Now the spell is broken
[125.72s -> 129.54s]  And I swear now I'm about to part with the fiction defined
[129.86s -> 132.84s]  It's time to fly out, to take off right now
[132.97s -> 137.24s]  Out of place, no I can't, I fade, I speed away
[137.43s -> 138.28s]  Kicking off the ground,
[138.56s -> 140.22s]  soaring up the sky with you
[140.22s -> 142.88s]  Covering the future that grows to great dire
[142.88s -> 144.04s]  I see you're changing it,
[144.16s -> 145.68s]  but you see your own mind
[147.40s -> 149.12s]  But this triumph you extended
[149.12s -> 152.46s]  A scope of all things you can reach out for
[152.46s -> 154.96s]  Grow to become so powerful
[165.06s -> 167.90s]  And all this money you will need to be born
[167.90s -> 169.44s]  To keep on living in this world
[169.66s -> 171.58s]  As time is flowing on
[171.58s -> 173.66s]  And so you love it all
[173.84s -> 176.56s]  So you will treasure it
[177.60s -> 178.96s]  Oh blessings fly,
[179.20s -> 180.72s]  they wait to you and wish you night
