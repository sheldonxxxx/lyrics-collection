  "reasoning": "The lyrics were retrieved from two reliable Japanese lyrics websites (uta-net.com and utaten.com) that specialize in song lyrics. The content matches the ASR transcript with high accuracy, including specific phrases like 'I feel delighted to music I adore' and 'Can I write every meaning to convey'. Minor differences such as 'I'm out of you' vs 'I'm out of fuel' are common variations in live performances versus official lyrics. Both sources confirm the English lyrics with a Japanese translation credit to Konnie Aoki. The song is part of YOASOBI's E-SIDE 2 album which features English versions of their songs.",
  "lyrics_content": "I feel delighted, to music I adore\nI say true thoughts I've always had in mind of you\nSomehow, I need you to receive it\nIt's something that I needed to express\nThough I'm a little shy\nI can't let go of thoughts I'm holding inside, I know\nCan I write every meaning to convey\nHoping this letter is in your reach\nIn spite of any situation\nEvery line of your voice reaching into my head\nProvides a power needed inside\nHey…\nI want to smile at all and every moment\nBut sometimes I hurt inside, I'm out of fuel\nBut, again, all I would have to do is stretch my hand\nTo you, reach out\nThe world would be so bright\nAnd every shade of it colorful\nLike all flowers bloom beauty\nWhen laughing, crying, no matter what happens\nSelection's up to me, whenever, tune in\nSo, today, I'm wondering what type of you I'll find\nUntil this world is gone, over, and coming to an end\nI'm wishing you resound, always\nIt's only you I think of, I always need you to be around\nWhen feeling like I gotta move it with your flow\nWhen feeling like the body is about to blow\nYou always did have my back\nAnd know that you truly saved my life\nInside my heart, it's moving, I cannot resist\nInside my heart, it's filling with a lot of bliss\nI want to be there and be by you\nEver surrounding me, staying close\nFrom now, evermore\nFor you are the one that I treasure\nHope you'll always be echoing\nCan I communicate every feeling\nPacked up into a letter you can read？\nDon't know if you're understanding what I write\nThough I'm afraid you haven't\nI can hope that you received all I wanted to say\nSent you what it is that I have been trying to get out of my heart\nSo, you know, I cannot stand the thought of us not being acquainted\nConception of it scares me because I love you that much\nEvery thought I wrote, accept it right now\nSo, when laughing, crying, on and on, for so long\nI'll walk ahead again, do so forevermore\nSo harsh and dark, and painful things would pile up, but as you know\nThis world is huge and wide, it overflows\nNo matter the hour, the place, music's pouring through\nAll I stand in front of and everything I'm waiting for\nIf I'm afraid, then what should be my next move\nDon't know what to say or do, I get so lost, and even though\nWhen I'm not feeling stable, as long as you are there by my side\nI'll keep on moving forward\nCalls out emotions hiding in my heart\nRolls out the motion deep in every thought\nIt's true, only you, music I love\nAnd nothing comes even close to take its place\nSomehow, for centuries to yet come\nSomehow, keep on resonating\nEvermore, oh, truly, I am grateful",
