[0.00s -> 3.62s]  I feel delighted to music I adore I say
[3.62s -> 5.78s]  true thoughts I've always had in mind of you
[5.94s -> 13.26s]  Somehow I needed to receive it So I'm a little shy I can't let go
[13.26s -> 15.40s]  Of thoughts I'm holding inside I know
[15.40s -> 17.72s]  Can I write every meaning to convey
[19.70s -> 23.52s]  In spite of any situation Every line
[23.52s -> 25.60s]  of your voice reaching into my head
[25.60s -> 27.60s]  Provides a flower needed inside
[29.18s -> 31.74s]  Hey, I want to smile at all and every moment
[32.16s -> 34.24s]  But sometimes I hurt inside, I'm out of you
[34.42s -> 34.86s]  But again,
[35.04s -> 37.40s]  all I will have to do is stretch my hand
[37.40s -> 39.82s]  Till you reach out
[39.82s -> 42.12s]  The world will be so bright
[42.12s -> 45.02s]  And every shade of it colorful
[45.02s -> 48.68s]  Like a flower is full of beauty
[48.68s -> 51.36s]  Well, I've been crying no matter what happens
[51.59s -> 53.54s]  Selections happen to me whenever I'm feeling
[53.54s -> 59.00s]  So today I'm wondering what type of you I'll find
[59.84s -> 61.36s]  Until this world is gone,
[61.68s -> 64.18s]  over and coming to an end
[64.18s -> 65.96s]  I'm wishing you reasoned ways
[82.94s -> 85.06s]  It's only you I think of,
[85.16s -> 87.96s]  I always need you to be around
[87.96s -> 89.72s]  What's in the life that I have to be pretty so?
[90.20s -> 92.18s]  What's in the life that I'm in is I gotta know
[92.68s -> 94.72s]  You always did have my back,
[95.02s -> 98.05s]  and now that you truly have my life
[98.41s -> 105.20s]  I want to be there and be by your every surrounding
[105.20s -> 108.14s]  Me staying close from now evermore
[108.34s -> 111.20s]  For you are the one that I treasure,
[111.50s -> 114.27s]  hope you'll always be echoing
[115.36s -> 121.04s]  Can I communicate every feeling packed up into a letter you can read?
[122.18s -> 123.98s]  If you're understanding what I write
[123.98s -> 124.26s]  Ah,
[124.82s -> 125.02s]  mmm
[125.64s -> 127.80s]  Though I'm afraid you haven't
[127.80s -> 130.62s]  I can't hope that you received all I wanted to say
[130.62s -> 133.40s]  Sent you what it is that I have been trying
[133.40s -> 135.54s]  To get out of my heart
[135.54s -> 140.08s]  So you know I cannot stand that thought of us not being acquainted
[140.43s -> 143.37s]  Conception of it scares me because I love you that much
[144.42s -> 145.18s]  Ah
[146.76s -> 149.24s]  Every thought I wrote, accepted right now
[149.68s -> 151.16s]  So when I've been crying out
[152.18s -> 154.02s]  I'll walk ahead again, do so forevermore
[154.58s -> 157.52s]  So harsh and dark and painful things would pile up
[157.52s -> 159.68s]  But as you know,
[160.36s -> 162.16s]  this world is huge and wide
[162.16s -> 165.66s]  It overflows no matter the hour
[165.66s -> 168.20s]  The place music's pouring through
[169.02s -> 171.38s]  All I stand in front of and everything I'm waiting for
[171.38s -> 173.78s]  If I'm afraid, I wish it'd be my next move
[173.78s -> 176.50s]  Don't know what to say or do, I get so lost
[176.58s -> 178.90s]  And even though,
[179.65s -> 181.15s]  when I'm not feeling stable
[182.18s -> 183.90s]  As long as you are there by my side,
[184.16s -> 186.18s]  I'll keep on moving forward
[188.00s -> 190.88s]  Cold-out emotions hiding in my heart
[190.91s -> 193.02s]  Rolls out the motion, deep in every thought
[193.06s -> 195.36s]  It's true, only in music I love
[195.36s -> 197.72s]  I'll make the deep end close to the end space
[197.97s -> 199.98s]  Somehow, for centuries I yet come
[200.36s -> 201.76s]  Somehow, keep on resonating
[201.98s -> 205.20s]  Ah, evermore, oh truly I am grateful
