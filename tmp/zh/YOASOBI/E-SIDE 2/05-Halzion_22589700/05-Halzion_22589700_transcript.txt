[14.20s -> 17.78s]  I'm sitting in two time it's passing by
[17.78s -> 21.30s]  Yet another hopeful thought of you
[21.30s -> 25.58s]  And that's fundamentally staring into a cool screen
[25.58s -> 28.74s]  Of pictures you and me were laughing loud
[31.88s -> 36.50s]  I'm not surrounded inside it and this go by rolling on
[36.50s -> 42.39s]  No matter what implies wish you was all I needed to meet once again
[43.58s -> 45.92s]  I'm not out of the world to speak, yet I believe
[46.37s -> 47.90s]  Even written I'm all alone
[47.90s -> 51.26s]  As you're leaving me here sitting as time is passing through
[51.26s -> 54.48s]  Many times I put together memories of you
[54.48s -> 57.55s]  I'm really out of my daily life
[57.75s -> 59.90s]  More days behind me yet to come
[60.00s -> 60.88s]  When in my head,
[60.94s -> 63.18s]  I fell away and I watched a boxing square
[63.18s -> 65.42s]  Before I had been searching in the sun
[65.42s -> 70.62s]  And I'm looking back and remembering what I am still holding on to
[84.58s -> 86.92s]  Draw lines and separate the loop back
[86.92s -> 89.60s]  It's our face in reality and I can't stand up
[90.00s -> 92.04s]  I could not realize, realize
[92.80s -> 94.30s]  Outer fast when it took my eyes off
[94.30s -> 95.86s]  Slowly swarmed the rays of love
[95.86s -> 98.32s]  Come soling deep, what something I could say
[99.38s -> 101.08s]  Wish I knew, wish I could have known
[101.08s -> 102.96s]  No better worn out is my heart
[102.96s -> 104.74s]  That closing doors I'll seal again
[104.74s -> 106.60s]  And stay over all alone
[106.60s -> 108.16s]  And close to the sun
[108.16s -> 110.16s]  Hiding loose in my own care line
[110.16s -> 113.04s]  Sustaining I'm the one you left alone behind
[113.86s -> 115.60s]  Above the blue sky scenery
[115.60s -> 117.66s]  Those leaves of you that cannot spring
[117.66s -> 119.30s]  I know deep inside of me
[120.00s -> 121.36s]  An alpaca war,
[121.56s -> 122.54s]  ivory bag,
[122.62s -> 127.98s]  atmosphere's heartbeat is pacing as you're bound in love with you
[128.48s -> 130.11s]  Allowing no one else to think,
[130.16s -> 132.92s]  we lift the veil while I'm still hiding with my hands
[132.92s -> 136.18s]  This moment I perceive alive inside within my truth
[136.18s -> 138.26s]  Eyes are closing as I call back,
[138.32s -> 139.71s]  while I started recreating
[140.03s -> 140.67s]  It's surprising,
[141.20s -> 142.16s]  I think of
[142.34s -> 144.24s]  Those days behind me,
[144.26s -> 144.86s]  living on,
[144.90s -> 145.70s]  scattered around
[146.02s -> 147.32s]  Reflection in my mind,
[147.38s -> 149.40s]  I was the vision I had in flowers
[151.01s -> 153.31s]  Now I can draw the hopes I pursue
[154.34s -> 155.24s]  Recall your downtown,
[155.46s -> 156.02s]  know your thoughts,
[156.06s -> 156.86s]  those days of us
[156.86s -> 158.66s]  How beautiful is time as well
[158.66s -> 162.10s]  We've been in a panorama in the moment of time
[162.10s -> 165.04s]  All feelings I took my eyes off now unite them
[165.04s -> 168.02s]  They connect the ways where I could have walked you
[168.64s -> 170.72s]  Those days behind me, now we're gone
[170.72s -> 173.46s]  I'm moving on to new horizons like the car
[173.46s -> 176.90s]  And from now on I will be walking even if you're gone
[176.90s -> 180.56s]  Dance to over, I'm smiling as I'm waving goodbye
[180.61s -> 184.86s]  Turn my back on that back as I start a movie now
