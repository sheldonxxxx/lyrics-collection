[0.60s -> 3.28s]  Why don't you try what you don't always do?
[3.38s -> 3.48s]  So,
[4.14s -> 6.74s]  as an actor, it's collaborating with your team
[6.74s -> 9.09s]  Lucky boy, Mr. Bust
[10.04s -> 10.62s]  That's a nice name
[10.62s -> 13.62s]  Most of it I can, most of it I can
[13.62s -> 13.98s]  Fight,
[14.20s -> 17.24s]  take a step out and the world's all sees that arm
[17.24s -> 20.76s]  Inside of it all, I care so let the flow around
[20.76s -> 23.20s]  I live and recall each hour I got
[23.20s -> 25.34s]  Today's shift ending so charming,
[25.96s -> 27.14s]  you do know how
[27.14s -> 29.38s]  So that way all of that joy
[29.49s -> 31.58s]  Rose after it turned into you
[50.46s -> 53.02s]  I was so on the move again and this morning
[53.02s -> 55.52s]  Whenever all the scenes appear I'm passed by me
[57.14s -> 60.34s]  Of what you're needing me to bring over to you
[60.50s -> 62.36s]  Receiving what you said to notify attention
[62.70s -> 65.10s]  Never mind that today the fortune was
[65.10s -> 69.46s]  If you go outside, comfort someone's shoes way
[69.46s -> 73.02s]  And so I just go about my own
[73.02s -> 75.20s]  Keep us somewhere there in my mind
[75.20s -> 77.20s]  Into another new day
[77.29s -> 80.82s]  Most of it I can, most of it I can
[80.82s -> 83.34s]  We take a step out in the world
[83.34s -> 85.58s]  Most of it I can, I do know what I can
[87.58s -> 90.34s]  I'll never recall each hour I'm on
[90.34s -> 94.24s]  It's a lovely feeling of that day turning around
[94.24s -> 96.60s]  So glad I'm feeling that joy
[96.62s -> 98.80s]  I rose on the rhythm, and to you
[99.09s -> 102.32s]  I got used to the heavy darkness on the screen
[102.32s -> 104.74s]  And I feel as if they forgot all about me
[104.74s -> 106.94s]  When I think about it, so unhappy
[107.68s -> 108.88s]  Wondering if I am necessary
[109.08s -> 111.96s]  I thought about you and reminded and flashed back
[111.96s -> 114.18s]  I know you need to feel like I'm not buying back
[114.18s -> 117.62s]  I take it upon me to live in
[117.92s -> 119.10s]  Go meet you
[122.00s -> 124.46s]  It's all that I need
[137.97s -> 140.62s]  Made any wonder so long for this morning
[140.62s -> 142.88s]  All moments of the sentimental learnings
[144.18s -> 147.36s]  Gone back, oh, I have quickly just hit the road
[147.36s -> 149.23s]  Suddenly, the felt of that kindness
[149.44s -> 152.90s]  Then you got to see it turn into the kindness that I got
[152.90s -> 157.68s]  All out rose on to be out back to you
[159.04s -> 161.22s]  Most of it I can, most of it I can
[161.22s -> 163.74s]  Since I could step out in the world
[163.74s -> 166.02s]  Most of it I can, oh, to know what I can
[166.02s -> 168.54s]  Act out of truth and to be my heart
[168.54s -> 170.70s]  And I won't say that, oh, since I resolved
[170.70s -> 174.68s]  A stupid suit when it nearly has now arrived
[174.68s -> 177.04s]  Finding all around as it flows
[177.20s -> 179.23s]  Go on now from you to my heart
[179.55s -> 180.29s]  Receiving it all
[180.48s -> 182.86s]  I know you've got it coming through
[182.86s -> 184.06s]  So focus on us
[184.06s -> 185.20s]  From me to you now
[185.20s -> 187.52s]  Joy is the feeling spreading around
[187.65s -> 188.80s]  I carry this out
[188.80s -> 189.92s]  And see the colors
[190.14s -> 191.64s]  Through every step out
[191.64s -> 193.94s]  I see kindness from me now
[194.15s -> 196.03s]  Arriving at the last to play roles
[196.58s -> 198.64s]  Forever going around as it flows
[201.92s -> 203.30s]  Revolving on and on
[204.92s -> 207.90s]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
[207.90s -> 210.28s]  On to live another day of that life
[210.28s -> 212.92s]  While you're living in a moment when you find
[212.92s -> 215.38s]  A little piece of joy that you're owed
[215.90s -> 217.52s]  I will be hoping that you will know it
