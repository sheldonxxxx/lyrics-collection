  "lyrics_content": "Why don′t you challenge what you don't always do?\nNow, an unexpected collaborator may appear\nThe lucky point is the bus\nMost of it I can, most of it I can\nIf I take a step out in the world\nSow seeds that are inside of it all\nI care, so let that flow around\nI live and recall what each hour I got\nToday shifts, ending, so charming, you do know how\nSo that way, all of that joy rolls on to return it to you\nI was so on the move again, and this morning\nWhen every old scenes appear and pass by me\nHave to take care of what you′re needing me to bring over to you\nReceiving what you said to notify\nAttention, never minded, today, the fortune was\n\"If you go outside, comfort zone should sway\"\nAnd so, I just go about my own\nKeep it somewhere there in my mind\nMost of it I can, most of it I can\nIf we take a step out in the world\nMost of it I can, I do know it, I can\nIn time, we could share some of that love\nI live and recall each hour I'm on\nIt's lovely feeling of that day, turning around\nSo glad, I′m feeling that joy, it rolls on to return it to you\nI got used to the heavy darkness on the screen\nAnd I feel as they forgot all about me\nWhen I think about it, so unhappy, wonder if I am \"necessary\"\nI thought about you, and reminded in flashback\nAn urge I need to feel, I could not fight back\nI take it upon me to leave and go meet you\nIt′s all that I need\nMaintaining wonder so long for this morning\nAll moments, all the sentiments, and all learnings\nBefore long, on the go, I have quickly just hit the road\nSuddenly, then felt a bit of that kindness\nThen you got to see it turn into the kindness that I got\nAll out, rolls on to be out, back to you\nMost of it I can, most of it I can\nSince I could step out in the world\nMost of it I can, oh, to know it, I can\nAct out of truth, and to be in my heart\nAnd now I see that all scenes will resolve\nAs to best suit when it nearly has now arrived\nFinding all around as it flows\nGo on now, from you to my heart, receiving it all\nI know you've got it coming through\nSoul focus on us, from me to you now\nJoy is the feeling spreading around\nI carry this out and see the colors\nThrough every step out, I see kindness from me now\nArriving into lives to play rolls\nForever going around as it tolls\nRevolving on and on, ah\nOn to live another day of this life\nBut while you′re living in the moment\nWhen you find a little piece of joy that you're owed\nI will be hoping that you will know it",
