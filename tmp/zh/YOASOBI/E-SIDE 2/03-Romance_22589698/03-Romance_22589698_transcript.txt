[2.78s -> 7.32s]  Happening so suddenly there was an incident that caught me off guard
[7.32s -> 10.38s]  What started out with the notes sent to me
[10.38s -> 13.36s]  Though out of reach, back in distant generations
[13.68s -> 15.22s]  Came from you to me,
[15.32s -> 17.48s]  so hard to conceive this type of meeting
[17.48s -> 21.90s]  Now you can find in my era, convenient new items
[21.90s -> 24.94s]  Cheers to when we left unknown to you
[24.94s -> 29.04s]  Foreign characters well into changing these feelings
[30.00s -> 32.28s]  A blossom of romance grew
[32.34s -> 35.86s]  In no way can we ever meet up in real life
[35.86s -> 39.18s]  You and I evolve our way in domains apart
[39.18s -> 41.16s]  So we're not frozen lines
[41.16s -> 42.62s]  Stacks of fused feelings
[42.64s -> 44.90s]  Profile not even known
[45.80s -> 47.54s]  In the center for now
[47.54s -> 49.26s]  Don't mind conditions
[49.51s -> 51.34s]  Expecting to love you worse
[51.58s -> 53.28s]  Waiting goes and I can't stand that
[53.30s -> 55.58s]  It is true, I don't think forever we go
[55.58s -> 57.46s]  Far beyond all limitations
[57.55s -> 60.52s]  Don't know why me and you, me and you
[60.52s -> 61.98s]  Are sending out a feeling
[62.12s -> 64.32s]  If my wish has got me through about
[64.70s -> 65.86s]  One glance is all I need
[65.86s -> 67.30s]  Oh I don't need you now
[67.30s -> 68.72s]  I love you that's why
[82.28s -> 84.94s]  A forcing thought I was reminded of
[84.94s -> 89.16s]  What's in your time in history recorded to be found?
[89.44s -> 92.88s]  A curse tomorrow, cause of all tears to fall
[92.88s -> 94.64s]  Too late to know it now
[95.87s -> 98.06s]  Somehow I'm in need of a miracle
[98.50s -> 100.34s]  So time went on,
[100.36s -> 101.48s]  as it flowed,
[101.48s -> 103.10s]  passing through all seasons
[103.10s -> 106.16s]  All your letters no longer reaching me
[106.16s -> 110.16s]  Those words that can't come to me but only hurt inside
[110.16s -> 112.52s]  Pressure onto my distances
[112.52s -> 114.50s]  and soons
[115.90s -> 119.44s]  What is found down the line from a hundred years ago
[119.90s -> 123.84s]  See it with my own two eyes as you hope to imagine in the future
[123.84s -> 126.98s]  The road that I'm now taking and still walking on
[127.18s -> 128.82s]  There's a feeling still holding on
[128.93s -> 130.66s]  I keep it locked inside my heart
[130.66s -> 132.56s]  So at last holding it,
[132.58s -> 134.34s]  your letter that came to me
[135.28s -> 137.59s]  Recognized and I'm reminded of those long-awaited
[137.66s -> 139.94s]  Countless that I have in my hand
[139.94s -> 141.80s]  For you and me on that day
[142.52s -> 145.38s]  Bring the design that has no top you love to me
[145.38s -> 149.28s]  You left and your era is sure the evidence of metal
[149.28s -> 150.74s]  Crossing the generations,
[151.14s -> 152.86s]  grasp better in my hands
[152.86s -> 154.88s]  I gather all truths I can see,
[154.96s -> 156.24s]  as we're alone today
[156.24s -> 157.42s]  From now in time,
[157.48s -> 159.28s]  I'll walk the way to let you know
