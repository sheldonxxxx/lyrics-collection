  "reasoning": "The song 'Haven't' by YOASOBI is an English-language track from their E-SIDE album. I searched for the lyrics using the Japanese term '歌詞' (meaning 'lyrics') to find reliable Japanese lyric sites that often provide accurate transcriptions of YOASOBI's bilingual content. I retrieved the lyrics from two authoritative sources: uta-net.com and utaten.com. Both sources provided identical English lyrics, confirming accuracy. The lyrics match the ASR transcript with high fidelity, accounting for minor transcription differences such as 'Saw you're not around' vs 'Say you're not around' and 'But could our knot climb up and keep on' vs 'But could I were not climb up and keep'. The presence of translator Konnie Aoki's credit on both sites further validates authenticity. Minor discrepancies are due to homophones in fast-paced singing, which is common in ASR outputs.",
  "lyrics_content": "Not enough, no time, you've gone before I cry aloud\nSoon go sit up, leaving not a tone in all we owned\nNo cold signs to me\nSaw you're not around\nIt all began alone in one morning\nI hear the beat of someone making motions\nInside of the space shared in our days\nLay on, I seal my eyes, and pondering it all\nHow do we know what brought it down\nWhy can't I know\nTrying to save it but I haven't\nBut could our knot climb up and keep on\nSuch unkind heart, ends creep on\nSaw you're not up to go on\nWe know where all that could wind up\nIt got hard, who am I to kid on\n\"You came to me\"\nThe small words used are pouring out\nI know the words are wrong now\nIt all began alone in one morning\nAn image of somebody coming to thought\nInside of it, a home I thought we belonged\nThe commonality's around without you there and\nWhy do we know you keep me down\nSo, that's it？\nI should blame my own, but still, I haven't\nA little time used, kicking love, I was shown\nSo let a sigh shoot, ending all my time with you\nWe're going down, down, for we let it eat the “no”\nFor just another example of an ordinary story now\nUpon the life we had that even shined\nSeemingly so bright\nAll caught in was soon covered in dust\nBut could our knot climb up and keep on\nSuch unkind heart, ends creep on\nSaw you're not in need to go through these streets\nOn what is soon dark\nIt got hard, who am I to kid on\n\"You came to me\"\nIt's too much when naturally\nWords like these pour right out\nWhere complication hiding got too hard to find\nIt could have been all around hot ethos\nCan't forget all you would see\nAnd end up walking just forgiving on\nWhen the affection suddenly behold\nA rising feeling of clouding days in madness\nNow we've got no more left to recover\nBut could our knot climb up and keep on\nBut could our knot climb up and keep on\nSuch unkind heart, ends creep on\nSaw you're not up to go on\nWe know where all that could wind up\nIt got hard, who am I to kid on\n\"You came to me\"\nThe small words used are pouring out\nI know the words are wrong now\nSo, let in more and climb up, and keep on\nSuch unkind heart, ends creep on\nIf we can leave and start over\nGo to that day, and turn around\nCan't help but thoughts are arising\n\"You came to me\"\nThe wrong words used are pouring out, but never reach\nI laughed out\nThrough cold breeze, and afar\nA sunrise",
