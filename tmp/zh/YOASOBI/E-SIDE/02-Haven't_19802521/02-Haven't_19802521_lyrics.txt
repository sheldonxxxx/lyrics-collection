Not enough, no time, you've gone before I cry aloud
Soon go sit up, leaving not a tone in all we owned
No cold signs to me
Saw you're not around
It all began alone in one morning
I hear the beat of someone making motions
Inside of the space shared in our days
Lay on, I seal my eyes, and pondering it all
How do we know what brought it down
Why can't I know
Trying to save it but I haven't
But could our knot climb up and keep on
Such unkind heart, ends creep on
Saw you're not up to go on
We know where all that could wind up
It got hard, who am I to kid on
"You came to me"
The small words used are pouring out
I know the words are wrong now
It all began alone in one morning
An image of somebody coming to thought
Inside of it, a home I thought we belonged
The commonality's around without you there and
Why do we know you keep me down
So, that's it？
I should blame my own, but still, I haven't
A little time used, kicking love, I was shown
So let a sigh shoot, ending all my time with you
We're going down, down, for we let it eat the “no”
For just another example of an ordinary story now
Upon the life we had that even shined
Seemingly so bright
All caught in was soon covered in dust
But could our knot climb up and keep on
Such unkind heart, ends creep on
Saw you're not in need to go through these streets
On what is soon dark
It got hard, who am I to kid on
"You came to me"
It's too much when naturally
Words like these pour right out
Where complication hiding got too hard to find
It could have been all around hot ethos
Can't forget all you would see
And end up walking just forgiving on
When the affection suddenly behold
A rising feeling of clouding days in madness
Now we've got no more left to recover
But could our knot climb up and keep on
But could our knot climb up and keep on
Such unkind heart, ends creep on
Saw you're not up to go on
We know where all that could wind up
It got hard, who am I to kid on
"You came to me"
The small words used are pouring out
I know the words are wrong now
So, let in more and climb up, and keep on
Such unkind heart, ends creep on
If we can leave and start over
Go to that day, and turn around
Can't help but thoughts are arising
"You came to me"
The wrong words used are pouring out, but never reach
I laughed out
Through cold breeze, and afar
A sunrise
