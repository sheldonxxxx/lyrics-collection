[0.00s -> 0.10s]  Ah,
[1.22s -> 4.48s]  like every day I see Another day repeats
[4.48s -> 8.26s]  I'm yawning all the time After all the cheers
[8.26s -> 9.20s]  The night,
[9.22s -> 14.06s]  it fades out And Shibuya re-sees the four of the morning light
[14.06s -> 15.22s]  And somehow,
[15.50s -> 18.86s]  an emptiness arose That's what I always feel
[18.86s -> 22.34s]  Something is not enough That's how it's gonna be
[22.36s -> 25.42s]  It's all about the vibe I let it be
[25.42s -> 28.08s]  See what, see what, covered deep inside
[28.08s -> 30.16s]  Let us hear the voice in you,
[30.30s -> 31.94s]  and resonate in you
[31.94s -> 35.24s]  All of pretending won't bring it out of sight
[35.24s -> 38.06s]  It is always waiting there for you
[39.26s -> 42.68s]  I'm calling for love, what I feel's to be drawn
[42.68s -> 46.24s]  Going by my selection in this colored up
[46.24s -> 49.58s]  Suddenly, with a breeze, overdrowns in morning
[49.58s -> 53.12s]  There was a world of blue shining in front of me
[53.19s -> 56.86s]  Like it was, you believe in a thing that you do
[56.86s -> 59.92s]  Can be too terrifying, but I know
[59.92s -> 64.76s]  I've finally come across a true discovery of what I got
[75.26s -> 75.82s]  Ah,
[75.94s -> 77.72s]  the more that I reach out,
[77.82s -> 79.36s]  my hands don't want to need
[79.36s -> 82.88s]  The further it becomes, another one of these
[82.88s -> 84.90s]  I'm really based gone
[84.90s -> 88.30s]  I'm always in a hurry as I'm struggling
[89.32s -> 91.90s]  Misery, steaming from all my thoughts
[92.05s -> 95.28s]  Humiliating brings new tears into my view
[95.28s -> 98.76s]  The more that I step in, the harder it becomes
[98.76s -> 101.58s]  Even the pain renews
[103.34s -> 106.42s]  I'm calling for love, what I feel is a move
[107.06s -> 111.12s]  Going by my selection in this path I walk on a night
[111.12s -> 112.02s]  Fighting off,
[112.10s -> 114.59s]  at least dropping heavy I'm gravitating,
[114.98s -> 117.08s]  the blue blue in front of me
[117.11s -> 119.92s]  Taking what you believe and to keep
[119.92s -> 122.62s]  doing so Every step's not only fun,
[123.08s -> 123.88s]  oh that's dying
[124.42s -> 126.00s]  Don't know if I'm able,
[126.44s -> 128.14s]  cause I am already little
[128.14s -> 131.74s]  Ah, one line was drawn, every one line was drawn
[131.81s -> 133.24s]  Missing in a confidence,
[133.62s -> 135.28s]  I try no pages I could draw
[136.74s -> 139.76s]  becomes everyone's sign becomes soon a large
[139.76s -> 142.40s]  accumulation of a strength that's out of view
[142.40s -> 145.62s]  all around i look at them comparing what i do with
[145.62s -> 149.50s]  them what is it only i can do that nobody else can
[149.50s -> 153.62s]  even define got not your confidence i'm moving
[153.62s -> 158.04s]  on covered in thought and emotion within
[158.04s -> 161.96s]  unknown to me a brand new feeling and on
[161.96s -> 164.72s]  the day i took the step for the first time
[166.64s -> 168.46s]  New pain that I felt too
[168.46s -> 170.52s]  Like it what I believe
[170.52s -> 172.46s]  And I'm facing it left
[172.74s -> 173.38s]  To a touch
[173.38s -> 175.36s]  All the preview of a lie
[175.80s -> 176.72s]  Gotta be alright
[176.72s -> 177.70s]  Let us go
[177.70s -> 180.26s]  All I can do now is to have a fun
[183.07s -> 183.32s]  Ah,
[184.28s -> 184.48s]  everything is
[184.90s -> 186.72s]  All the light as I drop
[187.04s -> 189.82s]  Using my own unique usage of colors
[189.82s -> 191.98s]  And every dawn, every night
[191.98s -> 193.66s]  I will keep on running
[193.66s -> 197.10s]  And now I found the blue glowing light of me
[197.63s -> 198.92s]  Like you want to believe
[199.42s -> 200.82s]  and I'm facing it too
[200.82s -> 203.94s]  Can be still terrifying but I know
[203.94s -> 208.32s]  No longer am I these versions of me living in transparency
[210.46s -> 211.14s]  Ah,
[211.14s -> 215.62s]  now I know how to be my precious incomparable yourself
[215.62s -> 218.26s]  See what, see what, cover deep inside
[218.26s -> 222.18s]  Let us hear the voice in you and resonate in you
[223.66s -> 225.48s]  Pretending won't bring it out of sight.
[225.84s -> 227.52s]  It is always waiting there,
[227.58s -> 229.86s]  still always waiting there for you.
[230.21s -> 232.48s]  See what, see what, covered deep inside.
[232.74s -> 236.36s]  Let us hear the voice in you and resonate in you.
[236.50s -> 239.72s]  Holla! Pretending won't bring it out of sight.
[239.84s -> 241.74s]  It is always waiting there,
[241.82s -> 243.54s]  waiting inside of you.
