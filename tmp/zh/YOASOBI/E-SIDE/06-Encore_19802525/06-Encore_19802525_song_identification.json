  "reasoning": "The lyrics were retrieved from two reliable Japanese lyrics websites (uta-net.com and utaten.com), both of which match each other and contain the English lyrics as performed by YOASOBI. The lyrics match the ASR transcript with minor variations in phrasing that are common in official transcriptions (e.g., 'Keep feeling no more' vs 'Keep feeling, no more'). Both sites credit Ayase as composer and Konnie Aoki for translation. The presence of furigana and official metadata confirms authenticity.",
  "lyrics_content": "I see that our world is over in one day\nKeep feeling, no more will you be seen past it\n\"I'll see you again\" would be untrue that day\nCannot be a wish to hold, we've got to hide it\nI see that our world is over in one day\nSo let us come on\nGo on and keep playing sounds until it's over\nMaking every tone louder so\nSurrounded by some shadows and a bit of light\nI open up my eyes, what's shown, unfamiliar room\nWe live in a world without a dark night\nAnd today, the world is ending life\nOn such a day, you were brought into my sight\n\"Do whatever you wanna do\"\nShort answer to me is all you left\nThen wandered off in to somewhere\nThe sound of you was fading afar\nAnd soon, I'm once again alone with me\nSitting in the cool feel of stagnant air\nAll is soon let up, all known to be owned\nTied up, recalling what ensued\nOh, what we got could lose all to woe, obtuse and waiting\nThe life in a cold world, all the retentions\nAnd every heartache-woven melody will end today\nSo, wave goodbye\nAlone inside his car, he drives along the route\nNo sign of life, as he enters a city by himself\nHe sees that tomorrow, an ending we shall reach\nWhat will a prayer do？\nWhen will a wish come true？\nDon't know what brought in the feeling\nWhat's got in keeps going, taking form of sound\nPiano notes of tones, a memory filled up in tones\nFollowing all that I'm feeling\nAnd tuning in our set of our breathing\nStacked and let out our tones\nSo warm and euphoric\nAnd nostalgic to me\nAnd through it all, they keep on flowing through\nOnce in the past, had all we could take\nRefraining to take out key old clues\nCan a day lure？\nA tone got to let us feel old memories\nKey got soon let up, a silent piano\nI soon know what leak out, longer let-out of tears\nNow let's keep it louder so\nAll is soon let up, all known to be owned\nTied up, recalling what ensued\nOh, what we got could lose all to woe, obtuse and waiting\nThe life in a cold world, all the retentions\nAnd every heartache-woven melody will\nSigh away from you and I\nWe now got caught in, so keen and owning\nTied up in tone's all that assumes\nFinal day here is you and me, we see nobody else\nWhen all is soon let up, all known to be owned\nCaught up in all we can remember\nOur tone got crossed, and rise in a tune\nI see that our world is over in one day\nI see that our world is over in one day\nIf we know the world is still around, I would stay\nAnd see an arrival of tomorrow\nMaybe you and me can depart and wish on it\nAnd then…",
