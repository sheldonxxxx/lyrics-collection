[0.00s -> 0.22s] I
[0.88s -> 3.26s]  see that our world is over in one day
[3.26s -> 6.20s] Keep feeling no more, will you be seen past it?
[6.32s -> 9.12s] I'll see you again, will be a true that day
[9.12s -> 12.08s] Can it be I wish to hold it, cause I hide it
[12.08s -> 15.00s] I see that our world is over in one day
[15.00s -> 17.76s] So let us come on, go on and keep playing sound
[17.76s -> 20.18s] Until it's over, making every dawn
[20.18s -> 21.12s] Let us all
[26.56s -> 31.04s] サラダパン サムシャドウ サンダーピーターライト
[31.94s -> 36.68s] I open up my eyes while shown in familiar room
[36.68s -> 40.96s] We live in our world without a dark night
[40.96s -> 44.10s] And today the world is ending like
[44.10s -> 47.52s] On Saturday you were brought into my sight
[48.94s -> 51.50s] Do whatever you wanna do
[52.64s -> 54.40s] Shun'ase to me is all you left
[54.40s -> 56.38s] Then wandered off into
[56.38s -> 60.18s] Somewhere the sound of you was
[60.18s -> 62.54s] Fading far and soon
[63.20s -> 66.98s] And once again alone with me
[66.98s -> 71.06s] Sitting in the cold field of stagnant air
[73.10s -> 74.18s] Only so little
[74.52s -> 75.78s] Oh don't you feel
[79.50s -> 83.39s] We got clues of the world of tears and waiting
[84.39s -> 86.40s] The life in a cold world
[86.40s -> 89.28s] All the irritations and every heartache
[89.28s -> 91.81s] Rubin mellowed three in will
[92.40s -> 94.56s] And today's a way goodbye
[97.09s -> 98.94s] Alone inside his car
[98.94s -> 101.31s] He drives along the roads
[103.14s -> 104.08s] No sign of light
[104.08s -> 106.74s] As he enters the city by himself
[107.48s -> 108.92s] He says that tomorrow
[108.99s -> 112.40s] An ending we shall reach
[112.89s -> 115.20s] What will our prayer do?
[115.83s -> 118.14s] When will our wish come true?
[137.30s -> 140.34s] Don't know what brightened up feeling
[140.34s -> 142.66s] What's gotten keeps going
[142.66s -> 144.52s] Taking form of sound
[145.03s -> 147.50s] Piano notes of tones
[147.50s -> 149.60s] A memory filled up in tones
[149.60s -> 152.02s] Following know that I'm feeling
[152.02s -> 156.03s] And tuning in our set of our rhythm
[156.98s -> 159.56s] Stuck there let out our tone
[159.56s -> 162.18s] So where may you fall back
[162.67s -> 164.77s] And nostalgia to me
[166.74s -> 169.52s] and through it all
[170.86s -> 173.80s] they keep on flowing through
[175.06s -> 175.82s] ah
[177.88s -> 179.74s] once in the past
[179.74s -> 181.18s] how long we could take
[181.18s -> 182.86s] refrain into take out
[182.86s -> 184.04s] key or clues
[184.04s -> 185.42s] かなって learn
[185.42s -> 187.36s] I don't gotta let us
[187.39s -> 189.09s] fill our memories
[189.80s -> 191.28s] 気がすれば
[191.28s -> 192.68s] I started piano
[192.68s -> 194.42s] 明日の終わりが
[194.42s -> 196.14s] longer than ever
[197.09s -> 200.10s] now let's keep it louder so
[201.44s -> 204.42s] all is lit up, all known to be
[204.42s -> 207.40s] all tied up, recalling what and soon
[207.40s -> 210.42s] all while we got clues of the world
[210.42s -> 212.12s] of the still waiting
[212.74s -> 215.18s] the life in the cold world
[215.18s -> 218.08s] all the retentions and every heartache
[218.08s -> 219.46s] rope and melody
[219.46s -> 223.64s] will sigh away from you and I
[224.92s -> 228.34s] We know that golden song can't end on end
[228.34s -> 230.86s] Tied up it all so that our souls
[230.86s -> 233.76s] Flyin' all day here is you and me
[233.76s -> 235.16s] We sing all night
[236.12s -> 238.56s] When all is lit up
[238.56s -> 240.62s] Hold on to be all caught up
[240.62s -> 242.46s] And all we can remember
[242.78s -> 246.86s] All time got crossed and rising up too
[248.68s -> 252.06s] I see that our world is over in one day
[254.84s -> 257.92s] I see that our world is over in one day
[260.68s -> 263.70s] If we knew the world is still around I would stay
[263.70s -> 265.70s] I see an arrival of tomorrow
[265.85s -> 268.38s] Maybe you and me can't depart away
[268.38s -> 269.68s] Shall we end it?
