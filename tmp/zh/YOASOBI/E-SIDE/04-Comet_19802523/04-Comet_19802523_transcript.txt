[0.88s -> 4.68s]  We now see through the night into the quietness
[4.68s -> 6.88s]  And driving to the street
[6.88s -> 10.36s]  Moving on with no destination
[12.58s -> 15.42s]  Sitting there to my left, a glance at you
[15.42s -> 17.52s]  The side of your face,
[17.84s -> 20.10s]  the moon was shining its light
[22.24s -> 25.72s]  Just like searching around within the history
[25.72s -> 27.94s]  Like crawling carefully
[27.94s -> 30.94s]  Slowly, somebody works together
[31.78s -> 33.12s]  One by one,
[33.92s -> 35.32s]  I was feeling the overflow
[35.32s -> 39.00s]  And thought of visions leading to
[39.57s -> 41.44s]  Memories of time with you
[42.82s -> 46.20s]  I know starting from the day feeling was set
[46.23s -> 49.02s]  Deciding to live by your side
[49.02s -> 53.62s]  Sadly, gradually, all my world's been changing
[53.62s -> 56.34s]  Just to be stronger than I feel
[57.94s -> 62.64s]  With an ink to my days of pretending
[64.29s -> 64.56s]  Suddenly
[65.22s -> 67.56s]  when you walked into my life
[67.56s -> 70.36s]  I saw the look deep in your eyes
[70.36s -> 74.92s]  It told me all the knowledge I had never knew before
[75.06s -> 76.90s]  When there is something to protect
[77.87s -> 79.94s]  That is the only thing I need
[80.40s -> 84.08s]  To be stronger than I could ever be a part
[101.74s -> 103.14s]  Moving in,
[103.36s -> 104.04s]  moving in,
[104.13s -> 106.62s]  deeper into the kept update
[106.62s -> 111.16s]  We will meet and soon together spending our time
[111.16s -> 115.26s]  Luring in new days to be full of all the comfort
[115.31s -> 119.24s]  It was full of joy and pleasure For you are
[119.24s -> 121.44s]  the one that was saving my soul all along
[122.80s -> 124.02s]  Now I can see
[126.11s -> 128.62s]  Capturing a little fragment of a
[128.70s -> 131.46s]  light It shined a big answer revealed
[131.46s -> 132.92s]  Moving on,
[132.98s -> 136.66s]  falling drops of tears Just like a shooting star
[136.66s -> 139.48s]  From a life full of imperfection It's
[139.48s -> 141.66s]  pouring out and slowly falling down
[141.66s -> 145.58s]  Those beautiful drops of tears
[149.44s -> 152.62s]  Even though the tent in it hide in me
[152.80s -> 155.08s]  That body lush and powerful
[155.20s -> 160.22s]  Even in that face resembling pain and sorrow
[160.32s -> 162.30s]  I can see beauty in it
[162.48s -> 165.44s]  I found the figure is the one it's all about
[165.44s -> 169.26s]  I finally have realized
[171.02s -> 174.62s]  Echoing into the night cold, I'll forget this
[174.62s -> 178.22s]  How the gun shot in the air, the fading breath
[178.22s -> 181.28s]  Epoch in guard, goodbyes approaching soon
[181.66s -> 184.08s]  I shot it for only an instant
[184.22s -> 186.98s]  I must have leased you this star I see
[186.98s -> 188.88s]  The wishes made a book,
[189.02s -> 190.94s]  it disappeared into the dark
[192.93s -> 196.80s]  In the palm of my hand, I felt it burning out
[196.80s -> 199.26s]  Color of the gold,
[199.54s -> 203.10s]  a comet of sincere true kindness
[204.93s -> 207.12s]  Touching the gorgeous man so beautiful
[207.12s -> 208.70s]  Deep in the shadows,
[209.62s -> 212.28s]  I held tightly within my hands
