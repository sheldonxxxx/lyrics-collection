  "reasoning": "The lyrics were retrieved from Musixmatch, a reliable lyrics platform with verified content. The English translation matches the ASR transcript nearly perfectly, including specific phrases like 'the look deep in your eyes', 'memories of time with you', and 'a comet of sincere true kindness'. Minor variations in phrasing (e.g., 'drive into the street' vs 'driving to the street') are common in translations and do not affect the overall accuracy. The song is originally in Japanese, as confirmed by the original title '優しい彗星' and romanized lyrics.",
  "lyrics_content": "We now, see through the night into the quietness\nAnd drive into the street, moving on with no destination\nSitting there to my left, I glance at you\nThe side of your face, the moon was shining its light\nJust like searching around within our history\nLike crawling carefully, combining words together one by one\nI was feeling the overflowing thoughts\nAll visions leading to memories of time with you\nI know, starting from the day, feeling was set\nDeciding to live by your side\nSteadily, gradually, all my world's been changing\nJust to be stronger than I feel\nAnd covering the weakness deep within\nInto my days of pretending\nSuddenly when you arrived into my life\nI saw the look deep in your eyes\nIt taught me all that knowledge I had never knew before\nWhen there is something to protect, that is the only thing I need\nTo be stronger now than I could ever be, I found\nMoving in, moving in deeper into darkest of days\nWe would meet, and soon, together, spending our time\nLuring in new days to be\nFull of all the comfort\nIt was full of joy and pleasure\nFor you are the one that was saving my soul all along\nNow I can see\nCapturing a little fragment of a light\nIt shined a bit and soon revealed\nMovement of falling drops of tears just like a shooting star\nFrom a life of imperfection\nIt's pouring out and slowly falling down\nThose beautiful drops of tears\nEven all the tenderness hiding beneath that body\nLarge and powerful\nEven in that face resembling pain and sorrow\nI could see beauty, this, I've found\nThe figure isn't what it's all about\nI finally have realized\nEchoing into the night\nCold unforgiving sound of gunshot in the air\nThe fading breath evoking our goodbyes approaching soon\nAnd shining for only an instant\nA merciless shooting star I see\nThe wishes made upon it disappeared into the dark\nIn the palm of my hand, I felt it burning out\nColor of the gold, a comet of sincere true kindness\nTouching the gorgeous mane, so beautiful\nDeep in the shadows, I held tightly within my hands",
