  "reasoning": "The lyrics were successfully retrieved from uta-net.com, a reputable Japanese lyrics site, using the native language search query 'YOASOBI Monster 歌詞'. The English lyrics from lyrical-nonsense.com match both the ASR transcript and the Japanese lyrics. Key matching phrases include 'Ah, so what a scene', 'overflowing laughing voices', 'pretended fabrications of a lie', 'what can I, that cannot be done', 'looking in those dark little eyes', 'get out to find it now', and 'still we reside inside a dry confusing big world'. The confidence is high but not perfect due to minor transcription differences in the ASR (e.g., 'toast' vs 'post', 'confine' vs 'another') which are common in automatic speech recognition.",
  "lyrics_content": "Ah, so what a scene, let's do another toast to confine\nMatch a city, overflowing laughing voices are\nPretended fabrications of a lie, blinded eye, deception\nI'm trying not to go mad\nCould a, could an aroma come and feed the brain in tune\nWith stimulation, reawaken inclinations\nDon't know who's gonna go there today, I wonder\nIf I kept trying then, what can I, that cannot be done\nOn to the world, what can I, that cannot be done\nLooking in those dark little eyes, I decide\nI need to not once let your tear fall beneath\nGet out to find it now, don't ever let go\nThe brighter future knows to reach it\nEven when the world is caught and full of wrong\nKeep needing ya to laugh and be free for once\nNo, I cannot be hurting no one\nI wanted, I wanted to be stronger now\nWoken to resume my need to stay the real me\nSo what a scene, here's to another safely passed time\nMasking every new bad rumor flowing in the city\nFeel the lie, feel the lie, release to turn a blind eye\nChoking on their own hysteria\nMarching with an innocence, they proceed\nTo a location echoing the sound of feet skipping and\nFeeling high, feeling high, memories of a lasting flavor\nThe other side's insanity\nCan you call the “standard good” a living at all\nAnd can “nobody feeling sadder” be a living at all\nHow is a straighter path you could see a living at all\nSo let's imagine going “no mistake” as living at all\nAnd I don't wanna live as you'd assume, be saying it's right\nAnd artificially be living and you're saying it's right\nI don't know what I'll be, and to believe this, I wonder\nWant to know the truth, what I'm inside and under\nOh, spill me the tale\nOh, spill me the tale\nStill, we reside inside a dry confusing big world\nI make a wish alone\nBelieve it, I just wanna be with you forever\nGive me hope to be just smiling with you again\nThe skipping beating in my heart\nIs shaking me within, and begins to shout\n“Now you got to move, go make the way”\nI will rise to prove the fragile little “myself”\nGo bite into my own and reach it\nEven when the world is caught, and full of wrong\nKeep needing ya to laugh and be free for once\nNo, I cannot see nobody cry\nI wanted, I wanted to be stronger now\nWoken to resume my need to stay the real me\nI'm gonna keep ya from danger, there are too many\nI'm running, I'm running, I'm running for you\nI will overcome what is residing for you",
