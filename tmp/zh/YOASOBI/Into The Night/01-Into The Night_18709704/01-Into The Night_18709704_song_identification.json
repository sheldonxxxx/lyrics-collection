  "reasoning": "The song 'Into The Night' by YOASOBI is the official English version of their Japanese hit 'Yoru ni Kakeru'. Multiple authoritative lyric websites (uta-net.com, utaten.com, kkbox.com) confirm the same English lyrics. The lyrics were cross-verified across three different sources (Uta-Net, UtaTen, and KKBOX) with perfect consistency. The ASR transcript matches the official lyrics with high accuracy, with minor transcription differences such as 'Season move' vs 'Seize a move', 'true night of me' vs 'true night on me', and 'tick-and-tocking mode' which appears correctly in all official sources. The presence of Japanese phrases like 'お疲れ様でした' and '騒がせぬ日々に' in the ASR transcript suggests some code-switching or background elements, but the primary language of the song is clearly English as evidenced by all official releases and lyric sources.",
  "lyrics_content": "Seize a move, you're on me, falling, and we were dissolving\nYou and me, skies above and wide, it brings on the true night on me\nAll I could feel was a \"goodbye\"\nThose only words you wrote, it's plenty to understand ya\nThe sun is going down, the sky behind and visions of you would stand\nOverlapping with you and the fence beyond\nRemember the night that we met up\nBroke into me and taken everything left in my heart\nSo fragile is that air, it always keeps on revolving near and wide\nLoneliness envelops deep in your eyes\nIt's stuck in \"tick-and-tocking\" mode\nNever refraining shamble, block of sound\nToo many terrible noises around\nAnd the voice ringing in me gets louder\nWith tears about to fall\nI need to find me an average happy tiptoe\nLocating, never tough when I'm with you\nSaw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights keep beating\nI'm going to you, and giving brighter shiny tomorrows\nWhat can \"night\" for you mean, infinite? You could run with me\nPlace your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up\nWant to leave it behind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid before\nI'm embracing you until more heat dissolve what is caught up\nSun will soon rise up into a day you're no more too afraid\nKeep all of me in you\nOnly perceiving through your eyes\nI see nothing, I'll soon hate you, keep me out, I'm crying out\nYou're falling into deeper fascination, giving away your love\nThat expression has got me crying out\nShe's gonna try to me, she's gonna lie\nGot to force a belief and trust to keep on\nEvery time it happens, heap of attack, and now I'm back in\nI got to cry, then who knows?\nSo we gotta keep on\nIf you gotta keep on\nThen we're gonna keep on\nOne day, we will understand, I'm believing in you\n\"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking\"\nAs I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in\nYou free my hand, then leave it\n\"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking\"\nNever told you the truth, I'm feeling that inside\nBack for another \"tick-and-tocking\" mode\nNever refraining shamble, block of sound\nKilling, oh, too many words that I gathered around\nWon't let me go to your mind\n\"I want it to be done\" is what went out\nIt found a way to finally leak out of me\nAnd for once, I could make you let out a smile\nSaw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights are keeping me down\nMy new images of you, now, appear heavenly now\nWhat can \"night\" for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone\nThey dissolve into the peace inside of you\nCalling to life, hit beneath, crying days in the eternal\nGive me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all\nSeize a move, you're on me, falling and we were dissolving\nSee me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move\nWant to leave it behind, tucked all days away, forget, and hid beneath\nHand in hand, extend to me, that let me know beyond falls\nThrough the seas of beyond, so loud and blows you afloat in the sky\nNew wind moving into you\nTonight, don't ever lose sight of me and let go\nYou and me are running through the night in dark, I'll take you",
