[7.94s -> 8.28s]  where
[8.28s -> 8.64s]  we've
[8.64s -> 9.09s]  disconnected
[9.72s -> 10.30s]  It's
[10.30s -> 10.36s]  your
[10.37s -> 10.82s]  first
[10.85s -> 11.10s]  two
[11.10s -> 11.38s]  reads
[11.38s -> 11.76s]  Now
[11.76s -> 11.98s]  we
[11.98s -> 12.24s]  go
[12.24s -> 12.76s]  once
[12.76s -> 12.96s]  again
[13.09s -> 13.48s]  But
[13.50s -> 13.84s]  where

[14.56s -> 14.78s]  split
[14.78s -> 14.88s]  up
[15.42s -> 15.66s]  Even
[15.66s -> 16.10s]  if
[16.10s -> 16.50s]  many
[16.74s -> 16.92s]  times
[16.92s -> 17.36s]  we
[17.36s -> 17.62s]  have
[17.62s -> 17.90s]  been
[17.90s -> 18.11s]  separated
[18.54s -> 19.22s]  You
[19.22s -> 19.38s]  can
[19.64s -> 19.74s]  see
[20.12s -> 20.22s]  we're
[20.22s -> 20.68s]  connected
[20.68s -> 21.40s]  still
[27.80s -> 28.52s]  So
[28.52s -> 29.02s]  goodbye,
[29.32s -> 29.88s]  farewell
[29.88s -> 30.30s]  then,
[30.43s -> 30.70s]  we
[30.72s -> 31.00s]  said
[31.00s -> 31.20s]  the
[31.20s -> 31.44s]  words
[31.44s -> 31.78s]  divided
[31.78s -> 32.54s]  How

[33.32s -> 33.54s]  and

[34.74s -> 35.00s]  ever
[35.00s -> 35.26s]  since
[35.26s -> 35.52s]  that
[35.52s -> 35.94s]  day
[35.94s -> 36.44s]  In

[41.56s -> 42.06s]  today
[42.06s -> 42.42s]  is
[42.42s -> 42.58s]  what
[42.58s -> 42.80s]  we
[42.80s -> 43.22s]  need
[43.22s -> 43.48s]  With
[43.48s -> 43.82s]  every
[43.82s -> 44.42s]  moment
[44.42s -> 44.82s]  that

[45.70s -> 46.04s]  our
[46.04s -> 46.42s]  meeting
[46.42s -> 46.96s]  time
[46.96s -> 47.42s]  I
[47.42s -> 47.52s]  can
[47.52s -> 47.90s]  feel
[47.90s -> 48.08s]  in
[48.08s -> 48.22s]  my
[48.22s -> 48.44s]  heart
[48.44s -> 48.94s]  beating
[48.94s -> 49.36s]  louder
[49.36s -> 49.78s]  as
[49.78s -> 49.92s]  the
[49.92s -> 50.22s]  seconds
[50.22s -> 50.70s]  pass
[51.40s -> 51.56s]  Look
[51.56s -> 51.70s]  up
[51.70s -> 52.02s]  at
[52.02s -> 52.34s]  the
[52.34s -> 52.58s]  sky
[52.58s -> 52.88s]  that
[52.88s -> 53.26s]  has
[53.26s -> 53.48s]  green
[53.48s -> 53.80s]  full
[53.80s -> 54.04s]  of
[54.04s -> 54.50s]  rain
[54.50s -> 54.96s]  It's
[54.96s -> 55.06s]  more
[55.06s -> 55.36s]  just
[55.36s -> 55.78s]  like
[55.78s -> 56.08s]  what
[56.08s -> 56.34s]  we
[56.34s -> 56.64s]  saw
[56.64s -> 56.96s]  that
[56.96s -> 57.34s]  day
[57.34s -> 58.06s]  Upon
[58.08s -> 58.46s]  us
[58.46s -> 58.66s]  was
[58.66s -> 58.88s]  a

[59.54s -> 60.10s]  bridge
[60.10s -> 60.56s]  Here
[60.56s -> 60.78s]  and
[60.78s -> 61.06s]  now,
[61.16s -> 61.44s]  we
[61.44s -> 61.68s]  were
[61.68s -> 62.20s]  able
[62.20s -> 62.58s]  to
[62.58s -> 62.88s]  meet
[62.88s -> 63.26s]  once
[63.26s -> 63.76s]  again
[63.76s -> 64.28s]  We
[64.28s -> 64.50s]  have
[64.50s -> 64.82s]  kept
[64.82s -> 65.18s]  our
[65.18s -> 65.78s]  connection
[65.78s -> 66.52s]  alive
[66.52s -> 67.02s]  all
[67.02s -> 67.30s]  along
[67.56s -> 67.82s]  But
[67.88s -> 67.98s]  since
[67.98s -> 68.20s]  we
[68.20s -> 68.50s]  talk
[68.50s -> 68.82s]  about
[68.82s -> 69.00s]  what
[69.00s -> 69.10s]  we
[69.10s -> 69.24s]  wanna
[69.24s -> 69.38s]  speak
[69.38s -> 69.78s]  about
[69.78s -> 69.96s]  I
[69.96s -> 70.12s]  never

[72.43s -> 72.78s]  Hold
[72.78s -> 73.08s]  up,
[73.12s -> 73.42s]  this
[73.60s -> 73.72s]  won't
[73.72s -> 73.90s]  be
[73.90s -> 74.00s]  lost,
[74.26s -> 74.34s]  I
[74.34s -> 74.46s]  mean
[74.46s -> 74.60s]  what
[74.60s -> 74.78s]  we
[74.78s -> 74.88s]  know
[75.42s -> 75.52s]  We
[75.52s -> 75.76s]  were
[75.76s -> 76.04s]  lost
[76.04s -> 76.46s]  by
[76.46s -> 76.66s]  the
[76.77s -> 77.20s]  seasons
[77.20s -> 77.72s]  forever
[77.72s -> 78.66s]  moving
[78.69s -> 79.04s]  Moving
[79.10s -> 79.20s]  and
[79.23s -> 79.74s]  beyond
[79.84s -> 80.24s]  where
[80.24s -> 80.40s]  the
[80.40s -> 80.76s]  rules
[80.76s -> 81.00s]  could
[81.00s -> 81.34s]  be
[81.34s -> 81.74s]  leading
[81.74s -> 82.34s]  us
[82.34s -> 82.50s]  to
[82.50s -> 82.84s]  No
[82.84s -> 83.12s]  matter
[83.12s -> 83.50s]  where
[83.50s -> 83.68s]  we
[83.68s -> 83.87s]  stand,
[83.97s -> 84.10s]  there's
[84.10s -> 84.12s]  a
[84.12s -> 84.30s]  plan
[84.30s -> 84.46s]  as
[84.46s -> 84.60s]  we
[84.60s -> 84.82s]  want
[84.82s -> 84.96s]  We
[84.96s -> 85.12s]  gotta
[85.12s -> 85.36s]  tie
[85.36s -> 85.58s]  our
[85.58s -> 85.76s]  strings
[85.76s -> 86.20s]  together
[86.24s -> 86.74s]  like
[86.74s -> 87.18s]  before
[87.18s -> 87.76s]  We'll
[87.87s -> 88.00s]  meet
[88.00s -> 88.46s]  again
[88.46s -> 88.92s]  soon
[88.92s -> 89.06s]  Ah,
[89.96s -> 90.06s]  what
[90.06s -> 90.62s]  was
[90.62s -> 90.75s]  this?
[91.10s -> 91.28s]  And
[91.28s -> 91.48s]  now
[91.54s -> 91.64s]  we
[91.64s -> 91.80s]  can
[91.82s -> 91.92s]  know
[91.92s -> 92.16s]  every
[92.16s -> 92.61s]  reminiscence
[92.90s -> 93.16s]  And
[93.18s -> 93.36s]  those
[93.36s -> 94.10s]  recollections,
[94.10s -> 94.86s]  retentions
[94.86s -> 95.00s]  We
[95.00s -> 95.22s]  trust
[95.22s -> 95.40s]  and
[95.40s -> 95.54s]  we
[95.54s -> 95.70s]  love,
[95.76s -> 95.90s]  fill
[95.90s -> 96.00s]  in
[96.00s -> 96.18s]  these
[96.18s -> 96.28s]  scenarios
[96.42s -> 96.82s]  We
[96.82s -> 97.02s]  believe
[97.22s -> 97.32s]  in
[97.32s -> 97.38s]  the
[97.38s -> 97.62s]  part
[97.86s -> 97.96s]  of
[97.96s -> 98.08s]  the
[98.08s -> 98.34s]  composition

[99.26s -> 99.42s]  cut
[99.42s -> 99.78s]  off
[99.78s -> 99.96s]  And
[99.97s -> 100.08s]  we
[100.08s -> 100.26s]  don't
[100.26s -> 100.38s]  even
[100.38s -> 100.58s]  need
[100.58s -> 100.70s]  to
[100.70s -> 100.86s]  worry
[100.86s -> 101.00s]  about
[101.00s -> 101.34s]  tomorrow
[101.34s -> 101.64s]  As
[101.64s -> 101.76s]  if

[101.94s -> 102.12s]  mess
[102.12s -> 102.20s]  and
[102.20s -> 102.34s]  then
[102.34s -> 102.44s]  we're
[102.44s -> 102.60s]  back
[102.60s -> 102.76s]  to
[102.76s -> 102.96s]  our

[106.44s -> 106.74s]  us
[106.74s -> 106.94s]  have
[106.94s -> 107.58s]  witnessed
[109.30s -> 110.00s]  There's
[110.00s -> 110.10s]  been
[110.10s -> 110.36s]  too
[110.36s -> 110.76s]  much
[110.76s -> 111.10s]  of

[113.14s -> 113.86s]  this

[114.22s -> 115.18s]  It's
[115.18s -> 115.38s]  all
[115.38s -> 115.68s]  about
[115.71s -> 116.02s]  surprise
[116.06s -> 116.46s]  That
[116.48s -> 116.98s]  everything
[116.98s -> 117.48s]  is
[117.48s -> 117.68s]  still
[117.68s -> 117.92s]  the
[117.92s -> 118.38s]  same
[131.22s -> 131.92s]  When
[132.19s -> 132.62s]  we
[132.62s -> 132.96s]  look
[132.96s -> 133.28s]  up
[133.28s -> 133.60s]  at

[134.28s -> 134.68s]  notice
[134.68s -> 135.18s]  it's
[135.18s -> 135.58s]  turning
[135.58s -> 136.08s]  white
[136.08s -> 136.48s]  We're
[136.48s -> 136.96s]  exhausted
[136.96s -> 137.28s]  and
[137.28s -> 137.46s]  we
[137.46s -> 137.72s]  see
[137.72s -> 138.12s]  up
[138.12s -> 138.34s]  on

[144.58s -> 144.82s]  like
[144.82s -> 145.14s]  what
[145.14s -> 145.38s]  we
[145.38s -> 145.72s]  saw
[145.72s -> 146.04s]  that
[146.04s -> 146.36s]  day
[146.36s -> 146.72s]  We

[148.40s -> 149.22s]  days
[149.22s -> 150.04s]  Hey,

[152.40s -> 152.60s]  have

[166.42s -> 166.74s]  where
[166.80s -> 166.90s]  we
[166.98s -> 167.38s]  lost
[167.38s -> 167.86s]  connection
[168.06s -> 168.66s]  within
[168.66s -> 169.18s]  our
[169.18s -> 169.68s]  stories
[169.68s -> 170.20s]  Once
[170.20s -> 170.62s]  again,
[170.78s -> 171.10s]  we
[171.10s -> 171.56s]  return
[171.56s -> 171.92s]  to
[171.92s -> 172.30s]  our
[172.30s -> 172.66s]  lives,
[172.72s -> 172.98s]  step
[172.98s -> 173.46s]  beyond
[173.66s -> 173.76s]  The
[173.76s -> 173.90s]  things
[173.90s -> 174.12s]  we
[174.12s -> 174.46s]  talk
[174.46s -> 174.78s]  about,
[174.86s -> 174.96s]  we
[174.96s -> 175.12s]  wanna
[175.12s -> 175.30s]  speak
[175.30s -> 175.71s]  about
[175.82s -> 175.92s]  The
[175.92s -> 176.20s]  pages
[176.20s -> 176.56s]  we'll
[176.56s -> 176.66s]  still
[176.66s -> 177.04s]  be
[177.04s -> 177.38s]  filling
[177.38s -> 177.76s]  up,
[177.78s -> 177.88s]  you
[177.88s -> 178.16s]  see
[178.16s -> 178.54s]  So
[178.54s -> 178.98s]  now,
[179.30s -> 179.46s]  let's
[179.46s -> 179.60s]  keep
[179.60s -> 179.84s]  on
[179.84s -> 180.14s]  adding
[180.19s -> 180.34s]  to
[180.34s -> 180.54s]  the
[180.54s -> 180.70s]  story
[181.34s -> 181.60s]  Even
[181.60s -> 181.90s]  the
[181.90s -> 182.52s]  setting
[182.59s -> 182.84s]  red
[182.84s -> 183.24s]  sun,
[183.36s -> 183.54s]  we
[183.54s -> 183.92s]  looked
[183.92s -> 184.26s]  up
[184.26s -> 184.42s]  at
[184.42s -> 184.84s]  once
[184.84s -> 185.26s]  And
[185.30s -> 185.40s]  the
[185.57s -> 185.72s]  blue
[185.72s -> 186.22s]  days
[186.22s -> 186.42s]  of
[186.42s -> 186.66s]  youth,
[186.76s -> 186.98s]  we
[187.16s -> 187.26s]  have
[187.26s -> 187.54s]  spent
[187.54s -> 188.14s]  together
[188.30s -> 188.82s]  Our
[188.82s -> 189.20s]  memories
[189.38s -> 189.50s]  won't
[189.50s -> 189.70s]  forget,
[189.92s -> 190.02s]  never
[190.02s -> 190.18s]  to
[190.18s -> 190.40s]  fade
[190.40s -> 190.70s]  away
[190.70s -> 190.92s]  I
[190.92s -> 191.04s]  like
[191.04s -> 191.14s]  the
[191.17s -> 191.34s]  way
[191.34s -> 191.56s]  the
[191.56s -> 191.82s]  grace
[191.82s -> 191.94s]  we
[191.94s -> 192.34s]  always
[192.34s -> 192.66s]  felt
[192.66s -> 192.94s]  We
[193.06s -> 193.16s]  can
[193.16s -> 193.66s]  meet
[193.66s -> 193.96s]  again
[193.96s -> 194.71s]  sometime
[196.08s -> 196.42s]  It's
[196.42s -> 196.58s]  always
[196.58s -> 197.00s]  dark
[197.00s -> 197.42s]  with
[197.42s -> 197.62s]  a
[197.62s -> 197.96s]  white
[197.96s -> 198.38s]  morning
[198.38s -> 198.88s]  sunshine
[199.06s -> 199.86s]  Every
[199.86s -> 200.26s]  time
[200.26s -> 200.54s]  it's
[200.54s -> 200.62s]  so,
[200.78s -> 201.10s]  see
[201.10s -> 201.34s]  ya
[201.34s -> 202.02s]  tomorrow
