  "reasoning": "The lyrics were retrieved from two reliable Japanese lyric sites (uta-net.com and utaten.com) that specialize in song lyrics. The content matches the ASR transcript with high accuracy, with only minor variations in phrasing (e.g., 'cleared from the rain' vs 'green full of rain'). Both sources contain identical lyrics, confirming their accuracy. The song is the English version of YOASOBI's '三原色', and despite being performed by a Japanese group, the lyrics are entirely in English as confirmed by both the transcript and sources.",
  "lyrics_content": "Don't know where we disconnected each of our stories\nNow we go, once again, past where we have split off\nEven if, many times, we have been separated, you can see\nWe're connected, still\nSo, goodbye, farewell then\nWe said the words, departed\nHow many morning suns have we seen ever since that day\nIn our respective new future destinations\nExtension of that day\nToday is when we meet\nWith every moment that leads up to our meeting time\nI keep feeling my heart beating louder as the seconds pass\nAs I look up at the sky that has cleared from the rain\nIt was just like what we saw that day\nUpon us was a seven-colored bridge\nHere and now, we were able to meet once again\nWe have kept our connection alive all along\nThe things we talk about\nWe wanna speak about\nAre never ending, overflowing out, and so\nHold up, this won't be loosening, for we know\nWe were rushed by the seasons, forever moving\nAnd beyond where the roads could be leading us to\nNo matter where we stand\nAs often as we want\nWe gotta tie our strings together like before\nWe'll meet again soon\nWhat was this？\nAnd now, we cannot end the reminiscence\nAnd those recollections, retentions\nWe trace and we laugh\nFilling in sceneries we were living apart\nThe conversation offer a shortcut\nAnd we don't even need to worry about tomorrow\nAs if in a machine, and we're back to our past\nIn any case\nSome changes that each of us have witnessed\nIn total honesty, there's been too much of them\nBut we know, till this day\nIt's all of our surprise\nThat everything is still the same\nWhen we look up at the sky, notice it's turning white\nWe're exhausted and we see upon one side of our cheeks\nA gentle touch and a stroke from the warmth of the sun\nIt was just like what we saw that day\nWe return to our individual days\nHey, every step that each of us have walked up to now\nHas been on separate pathways, we know\nBut the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us\nWe've got to, once again, overlap now\nDon't know where we lost connection within our stories\nOnce again, we return to what lies there beyond\nThe things we talk about\nWe wanna speak about\nThe pages will soon be filling up, you'll see\nSo, now, let's keep on adding to the story\nEven the setting red sun we looked up at once\nAnd the blue days of youth we have spent together\nOur memories won't forget\nNever to fade away\nAnd like the way the greens will always sprout\nWe can meet again some time\nOur stories always start\nWith a white morning sunshine every time, and so\n“See ya tomorrow”",
