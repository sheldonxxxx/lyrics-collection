The lyrics match the provided ASR transcript with high accuracy, with only minor differences in phrasing (e.g., 'Colors calling for me' vs 'Call is calling for me', 'Flower town' vs 'Flower down').

  "lyrics_content": "Flutter, fluttering\nHover, hovering\nColors calling for me\nBlossoms in a spree\nFlower town I see in my memory lights my soul from this sky\nCould not foresee and was distraught\nI was brought into a place unsought\nDistant and so far outta my sight\nA pristine scene shining bright\nHave to feel a sparkle running inside as doubts divide\nThen visions open wide\nReveal a world that is so vibrant\nEach time you give me hopeless challenges\nUnsuspected, the answer is sewn in what's unknown\nBut I'll find it, oh trust me\nI close in on the end, beyond that route\nI'm bound to see a brand new scene, past all lingering doubt\nWonders so eerie, a chain of mysteries\nTo keep on rolling in like endless histories\nAll hidden tricks, plotting in shadows\nI'm 'bout to unveil, set to show\nNo matter what challenge unwinds\nI know there is a scheme and seeds to find\nAll side effects are mine to defy\nCause I'll find it and reveal it\nUnveiling lies\nI'm in this very place, I've been so close to all these feelings\nAll the sadness and that joy\nAnd all the people's emotions are touching my soul\nIt sways with the truth\nHave to feel a sparkle rushing inside as doubts divide\nThen visions open wide\nI'm in a world that is so vibrant\nEach day you give me hopeless challenges\nUnsuspected, the answer is sewn in what's unknown\nBut I'll find it, oh trust me\nI close in on the end, beyond that route\nI'm bound to see a brand new me, past all lingering doubt\nUnknown, couldn't guess\nNever thought back in those days\nThe future that has started blooming today\nI wouldn't mind a time like this, I can't really complain\nFlutter, fluttering\nHover, hovering\nCycle to restart\nNear and then apart\nSo the wind may stray, let your body sway\nStill night, dance anew",
