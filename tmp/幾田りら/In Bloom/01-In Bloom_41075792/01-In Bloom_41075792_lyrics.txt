Flutter, fluttering
Hover, hovering
Colors calling for me
Blossoms in a spree
Flower town I see in my memory lights my soul from this sky
Could not foresee and was distraught
I was brought into a place unsought
Distant and so far outta my sight
A pristine scene shining bright
Have to feel a sparkle running inside as doubts divide
Then visions open wide
Reveal a world that is so vibrant
Each time you give me hopeless challenges
Unsuspected, the answer is sewn in what's unknown
But I'll find it, oh trust me
I close in on the end, beyond that route
I'm bound to see a brand new scene, past all lingering doubt
Wonders so eerie, a chain of mysteries
To keep on rolling in like endless histories
All hidden tricks, plotting in shadows
I'm 'bout to unveil, set to show
No matter what challenge unwinds
I know there is a scheme and seeds to find
All side effects are mine to defy
Cause I'll find it and reveal it
Unveiling lies
I'm in this very place, I've been so close to all these feelings
All the sadness and that joy
And all the people's emotions are touching my soul
It sways with the truth
Have to feel a sparkle rushing inside as doubts divide
Then visions open wide
I'm in a world that is so vibrant
Each day you give me hopeless challenges
Unsuspected, the answer is sewn in what's unknown
But I'll find it, oh trust me
I close in on the end, beyond that route
I'm bound to see a brand new me, past all lingering doubt
Unknown, couldn't guess
Never thought back in those days
The future that has started blooming today
I wouldn't mind a time like this, I can't really complain
Flutter, fluttering
Hover, hovering
Cycle to restart
Near and then apart
So the wind may stray, let your body sway
Still night, dance anew
