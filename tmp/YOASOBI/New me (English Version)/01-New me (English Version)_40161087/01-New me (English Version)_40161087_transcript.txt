[7.12s -> 11.64s]  I keep on living for that day-to-day so plain and flat
[11.68s -> 13.78s]  And your love change came to me,
[13.90s -> 15.94s]  the faithful day now here's the story
[16.44s -> 17.73s]  And I feel loved,
[18.20s -> 22.85s]  I know I will be growing closer than all my thoughts could hold
[23.00s -> 26.26s]  To turning into that new me
[28.40s -> 31.01s]  Hands down got better with my smile
[31.42s -> 33.14s]  And pleasant side
[33.80s -> 37.30s]  I put on day by day but now I'm worn out
[37.30s -> 39.94s]  My true self is nowhere to be found
[39.94s -> 42.48s]  Thinking that I'm feeling good
[42.66s -> 44.62s]  And lying that I'm feeling real
[44.62s -> 45.86s]  Can't I take anymore?
[46.28s -> 47.70s]  Hey you, are you dating now?
[47.80s -> 48.98s]  So just give it a go
[48.98s -> 50.52s]  Not the second that day
[50.52s -> 52.90s]  My butt, I hate to bumble
[52.90s -> 54.56s]  And I don't wanna talk it
[56.26s -> 58.48s]  I had to try, I promised that I would
[58.48s -> 61.22s]  So it led up to that day I met you
[62.08s -> 64.88s]  Marching into the world that morning,
[65.00s -> 65.38s]  that station
[65.92s -> 71.04s]  I make a thoughtful choice and I dress nice but not special
[71.70s -> 74.42s]  The clear joy coming from your voice
[75.00s -> 79.70s]  As you call out my name, it makes me rejoice
[79.70s -> 81.63s]  My dreams rise and rise
[81.78s -> 84.84s]  I don't know what you mean at all
[84.84s -> 86.92s]  Oh, I've met me alone
[86.92s -> 89.34s]  Rolling in with the facts you show
[89.34s -> 91.28s]  I've met me alone
[91.28s -> 93.20s]  I've met things we stayed in
[93.47s -> 96.14s]  Never thought that encounter would be
[96.29s -> 99.02s]  The sudden start of the story
[101.16s -> 103.16s]  Newly made up this way
[103.16s -> 105.72s]  The great is our dog and now
[106.84s -> 109.08s]  It's unfolded in no time
[109.09s -> 111.04s]  Passionate with, we're leaving behind
[111.78s -> 113.12s]  All these world of world games,
[113.12s -> 114.38s]  it's just me and you
[115.16s -> 117.18s]  We play for city views
[117.18s -> 119.58s]  So I've met the unknown
[119.58s -> 121.96s]  I don't know what you mean at all
[121.96s -> 124.06s]  Oh, I've met the unknown
[124.06s -> 126.42s]  With that oversized shirt you wore
[126.42s -> 128.42s]  I've met the unknown
[128.42s -> 130.70s]  Don't know what path I'd call my own
[130.70s -> 133.16s]  This turn of fate is hard to conceive
[133.22s -> 136.00s]  And oh, the feelings you gave me now
[136.40s -> 138.22s]  This day of new sights you've endowed
[138.22s -> 140.35s]  They have got unthrown to my heart
[141.78s -> 144.76s]  me realize what I've always kept on
[144.76s -> 149.08s]  Hidden inside me must have been the place I've put on
[149.08s -> 151.32s]  And I still finally know that one
[151.86s -> 155.01s]  time for me to seize that new future taken
[156.00s -> 158.42s]  And break apart my former self,
[158.48s -> 160.52s]  tell none of it it's last
[160.52s -> 161.15s]  Oh oh,
[161.76s -> 164.32s]  don't mind what type of place got
[165.04s -> 169.14s]  I'll be me, living this being not a Virgo
[169.29s -> 171.00s]  Because it's not a joke
[171.01s -> 174.30s]  I feel like I'm lost in parts of my head
[174.30s -> 176.48s]  Oh, I need more and more
[176.48s -> 176.94s]  Ah,
[176.94s -> 182.00s]  the routine of today and all the things that show up dry and dull
[182.00s -> 183.71s]  Are about to be over
[183.72s -> 184.54s]  Ah,
[185.25s -> 189.58s]  not looking back because today is the start of my brand new way
[189.58s -> 192.08s]  Beginning now, it's my own story
[200.82s -> 200.88s]  Thank you.
