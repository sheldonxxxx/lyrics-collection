  "lyrics_content": "1.I keep on living for that day-to-day, so plain and flat\n2.Until a change came to me that fateful day\n3.Now here’s the story\n4.And as the tale unfolds\n5.I know I will be growing closer than all my thoughts could hold\n6.To turning into that New Me7.\n8.Hands down, got better with my smile\n9.And pleasant side, I put on day by day\n10.But now, I’m worn out\n11.My true self is nowhere to be found\n12.Faking that “I’m feeling good”\n13.And lying that “I’m feeling you”\n14.Cannot take any more15.\n16.Hey you, are you dating now?\n17.So, just give it a go\n18.Not this again…\n19.Bad day\n20.Bad things\n21.My boss\n22.Uh, oh…\n23.I hate him so much, and I don’t want us talking\n24.Heavy heart, but I thought that I had to try\n25.I promised that I would\n26.So it led up to that day I’ve met you27.\n28.Marching into the wild at morn in that station\n29.I make a thoughtful choice\n30.And I dress nice but not special\n31.The clear joy coming from your voice as you call out my name\n32.It makes me rejoice\n33.My face rising bright34.\n35.I’ve met the unknown\n36.I don’t know what you mean at all\n37.Oh, I’ve met the unknown\n38.Rolling in with the bangs you show\n39.I’ve met the unknown\n40.I’ve met him, he’s mysterious\n41.Never thought that encounter would be the sudden start of that story42.\n43.Newly met up this way\n44.The greetings are done, and now, it’s unfolding in no time\n45.Dash in the wind\n46.We’re leaving behind the rhythm of days full of routines\n47.It’s just me and you\n48.We break through city views49.\n50.So, I’ve met the unknown\n51.I don’t know what you mean at all\n52.Oh, I’ve met the unknown\n53.With that oversized shirt you wore\n54.I’ve met the unknown\n55.Don’t know what path I’d call my own\n56.This turn of fate is hard to conceive\n57.And though…58.\n59.The feelings you gave me now\n60.This day of new sights you’ve bestowed\n61.They have gotten through to my heart\n62.And they have made me realize\n63.What I’ve always kept on hating inside me must have been the face I’ve put on\n64.And the self I’ve been all that while65.\n66.Time for me to seize that new future, take off\n67.And break apart my former self till none of it is left\n68.Uh, oh…\n69.Don’t mind what type of days come\n70.I’ll be me, living as me and not undergo\n71.Because it’s what I chose72.\n73.I’ve met the unknown\n74.Unlocking doors all of my own\n75.Oh, I’ll meet new unknowns\n76.The routine of today\n77.And all the days that show up dry and dull are about to be over\n78.No looking back because today is the start of my brand new way\n79.Beginning now, it’s my own story",
