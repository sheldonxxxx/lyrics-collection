[167.52s -> 167.68s]  being
[167.68s -> 168.26s]  not
[168.26s -> 168.56s]  a
[168.56s -> 169.14s]  Virgo
[169.29s -> 169.94s]  Because
[169.94s -> 170.44s]  it's
[170.44s -> 170.54s]  not
[170.54s -> 170.80s]  a
[170.80s -> 171.00s]  joke
[171.01s -> 171.66s]  I
[171.66s -> 171.66s]  feel
[171.66s -> 172.12s]  like
[172.12s -> 172.52s]  I'm
[172.52s -> 172.78s]  lost
[172.86s -> 173.08s]  in

[174.30s -> 174.40s]  Oh,
[174.80s -> 174.92s]  I
[174.92s -> 175.56s]  need
[175.56s -> 176.02s]  more
[176.02s -> 176.28s]  and
[176.28s -> 176.48s]  more
[176.48s -> 176.94s]  Ah,
[176.94s -> 177.66s]  the
[177.89s -> 178.42s]  routine
[178.42s -> 178.76s]  of
[178.76s -> 179.18s]  today
[179.23s -> 179.54s]  and
[179.54s -> 179.74s]  all
[179.74s -> 180.08s]  the
[180.08s -> 180.46s]  things
[180.46s -> 180.68s]  that
[180.68s -> 180.92s]  show
[180.92s -> 181.26s]  up
[181.26s -> 181.52s]  dry
[181.52s -> 181.72s]  and
[181.72s -> 182.00s]  dull
[182.00s -> 182.26s]  Are
[182.40s -> 182.52s]  about
[182.52s -> 182.78s]  to
[182.78s -> 183.06s]  be
[183.06s -> 183.71s]  over
[183.72s -> 184.54s]  Ah,
[185.25s -> 185.50s]  not
[185.50s -> 186.00s]  looking
[186.05s -> 186.40s]  back
[186.40s -> 186.84s]  because
[186.88s -> 187.24s]  today
[187.24s -> 187.64s]  is
[187.64s -> 187.96s]  the
