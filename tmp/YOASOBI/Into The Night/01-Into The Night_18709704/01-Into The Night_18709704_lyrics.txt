Seize a move, you're on me, falling, and we were dissolving
You and me, skies above and wide, it brings on the true night on me
All I could feel was a "goodbye"
Those only words you wrote, it's plenty to understand ya
The sun is going down, the sky behind and visions of you would stand
Overlapping with you and the fence beyond
Remember the night that we met up
Broke into me and taken everything left in my heart
So fragile is that air, it always keeps on revolving near and wide
Loneliness envelops deep in your eyes
It's stuck in "tick-and-tocking" mode
Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Too many terrible noises around
And the voice ringing in me gets louder
With tears about to fall
I need to find me an average happy tiptoe
Locating, never tough when I'm with you
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights keep beating
I'm going to you, and giving brighter shiny tomorrows
What can "night" for you mean, infinite? You could run with me
Place your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up
Want to leave it behind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid before
I'm embracing you until more heat dissolve what is caught up
Sun will soon rise up into a day you're no more too afraid
Keep all of me in you
Only perceiving through your eyes
I see nothing, I'll soon hate you, keep me out, I'm crying out
You're falling into deeper fascination, giving away your love
That expression has got me crying out
She's gonna try to me, she's gonna lie
Got to force a belief and trust to keep on
Every time it happens, heap of attack, and now I'm back in
I got to cry, then who knows?
So we gotta keep on
If you gotta keep on
Then we're gonna keep on
One day, we will understand, I'm believing in you
"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking"
As I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in
You free my hand, then leave it
"No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking"
Never told you the truth, I'm feeling that inside
Back for another "tick-and-tocking" mode
Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Killing, oh, too many words that I gathered around
Won't let me go to your mind
"I want it to be done" is what went out
It found a way to finally leak out of me
And for once, I could make you let out a smile
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights are keeping me down
My new images of you, now, appear heavenly now
What can "night" for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone
They dissolve into the peace inside of you
Calling to life, hit beneath, crying days in the eternal
Give me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all
Seize a move, you're on me, falling and we were dissolving
See me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move
Want to leave it behind, tucked all days away, forget, and hid beneath
Hand in hand, extend to me, that let me know beyond falls
Through the seas of beyond, so loud and blows you afloat in the sky
New wind moving into you
Tonight, don't ever lose sight of me and let go
You and me are running through the night in dark, I'll take you
