[8.70s -> 12.84s] You and me Skies above the white it brings on a true night of me
[31.00s -> 33.31s] All I could do was a goodbye
[33.47s -> 35.18s] Those only words you wrote
[35.18s -> 37.24s] It's funny to understand, yeah
[37.24s -> 39.22s] The sun is going down the sky
[39.22s -> 41.50s] Behind a vision to your stand
[41.50s -> 43.30s] All about laughing with you
[43.30s -> 44.70s] And the fans beyond
[44.84s -> 48.36s] Remember the night that we met up
[48.36s -> 49.98s] Broke into me and taken
[49.98s -> 52.04s] Everything left in my heart
[52.04s -> 53.66s] So far, you're in the air
[53.66s -> 54.88s] Let all the kids sound
[54.88s -> 56.28s] Revolving you and my
[56.28s -> 59.50s] Loneliness envelopes deep in your eyes
[87.08s -> 90.76s] お疲れ様でした
[91.00s -> 93.22s] Good days and if you may be people
[93.22s -> 95.36s] I'm embracing you until more
[95.36s -> 96.93s] Heat this heart but I've caught up
[97.25s -> 98.38s] Some will soon rise
[98.38s -> 101.38s] Love into a day you're no more to afraid
[101.38s -> 102.90s] Keep on loving you
[118.18s -> 120.36s] Only perceived into your eyes
[121.60s -> 124.06s] I'm crying out
[124.06s -> 126.40s] You falling into deep fascination
[126.82s -> 128.40s] Giving away your love
[128.40s -> 131.02s] That expression has got me crying out
[131.92s -> 133.22s] She's gonna try to me
[133.22s -> 134.78s] She's gonna like what the force I believe
[134.78s -> 135.76s] And trust to keep on
[135.76s -> 137.00s] Everytime you have to see
[137.00s -> 138.06s] Pubert talking on back
[138.06s -> 138.84s] And I got to cry
[138.84s -> 139.58s] Who knows?
[139.58s -> 140.58s] So we gotta keep on
[140.58s -> 141.50s] If you gotta keep on
[141.50s -> 142.44s] Then we gotta keep on
[142.44s -> 143.78s] One day we will understand
[143.78s -> 145.56s] I believe in you
[160.18s -> 162.60s] No one stop it you got me tired of walking
[162.60s -> 165.20s] As a showman is I reach to get back on
[165.20s -> 167.82s] Still no further you bring my hand and leave it
[167.82s -> 170.06s] No one stop it you got me tired of walking
[170.06s -> 173.30s] Never told you the truth I'm feeling that inside
[174.40s -> 176.16s] Black boy not a dick I talk in mood
[176.16s -> 178.08s] Never refrain each and all the blockers sound
[178.08s -> 180.02s] Getting on too many walls that I gather around
[180.02s -> 181.20s] Well let me go to your mind
[181.20s -> 183.46s] I want it to be done that's what we know
[183.47s -> 185.36s] If I don't like it then I really get on me
[185.42s -> 188.54s] And for once I can make you the loudest night
[191.30s -> 192.92s] 騒がせぬ日々に

[200.12s -> 202.28s] Mean when fallen tears and tears are gone
[202.28s -> 205.10s] They dissolve into the peace inside of you
[205.22s -> 209.40s] I like the life you've been in
[209.60s -> 210.94s] Crying this is the eternal
[211.19s -> 214.60s] Give me what I saw and you all want to end this all
[215.36s -> 218.88s] Season move you're on me Falling then we will dissolve it
