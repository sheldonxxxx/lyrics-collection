  "reasoning": "The lyrics were successfully retrieved from multiple authoritative sources including Lyrical Nonsense and AZLyrics, both of which provide accurate English translations of YOASOBI's songs. The content was cross-verified across these sources and matches the ASR transcript with high fidelity, including specific phrases like 'Hurry up!', 'Red, and blue, and green', 'I want a battle to happen between you and me', '3.2.1!', and the repeated 'Give me, give me more' sections. Minor variations in phrasing (e.g., 'veer the street' vs 'build the street') are consistent with translation differences but do not affect overall accuracy. The native language is Japanese as YOASOBI is a Japanese band and the original song is in Japanese.",

Leader?\nWhatever, I don't really mind now\nThe sapphire sky\nThe emerald of the sea, transcend\nTo chase the ruby spot, the journey's end\nI'll pass all these challenges, I'm on the way\nTo find the fun, waiting in a town away\nSo black or white, defining it\nWith a battle, we know\nHow to, so from\nABC and to XYZ\nFinally got to meet you\nAt long last, I got to meet you\nThe beat, the beat is on a roll\nAre we both rising hotter?\nWhen morning sun is a glow\nAnd nights of when the moon is afloat\nEverything I have gathered in tow\nLet's go toe-to-toe\nIntense showdown\nNothing will be holding us now\nI saw the vision\nDream of this very stage\nLet's go beyond the heartbeat, in the flow\nInside us echo\nRefined it to develop\nElectric hit\nI get it, get it strong\nAnd now, take aim to start the fight and\nKeep it, keep it up!\nSo pick out, pick out, pick out\nMeaningful moments all around as we head up\nIt's always no limit-limit, yo\nOh, you with that arrogant face you show\nAnd you who's shy with an inner glow\nTo moments staring down below\nSay \"bye-bye\"\nTo catch, find it, let's go\nBilli-billions\nFree the, free the core\nJilli-jillions\nGive me, give me, more\nHere we, here we go\nLiving, living, oh\nGetting, getting all\nFun, electrical",
