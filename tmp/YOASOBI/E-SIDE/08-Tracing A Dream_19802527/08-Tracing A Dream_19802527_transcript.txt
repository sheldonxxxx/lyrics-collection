[0.86s -> 4.86s]  Feeling all the skies of night in soon creates a flower
[4.86s -> 10.92s]  City voices are all rotten but the shining light and sounds removed
[10.92s -> 15.54s]  World of all silence all that was left is too alone
[15.62s -> 19.40s]  Then echoing out the words that I'm in love with you
[35.42s -> 38.36s]  You made up with me inside a dream,
[38.48s -> 39.70s]  our future was shown
[39.70s -> 42.70s]  Night of summer, you and me formed
[42.91s -> 45.68s]  Silhouettes, my right there next to you
[45.68s -> 50.28s]  Final love of fireworks, the rising to the sky
[50.28s -> 54.06s]  When it fades away, that'll be the sign for this
[55.68s -> 57.96s]  It's you and ordinary morning
[58.03s -> 61.20s]  It's an ordinary looking image you caught on
[61.20s -> 62.08s]  Always in for me,
[62.12s -> 65.16s]  breaking every eye contact with you was
[65.16s -> 70.32s]  Ah, for I have been consumed by words let out
[70.32s -> 73.00s]  And what you've shown, even now
[73.00s -> 75.58s]  Still have red tums to keep ringing on inside
[77.70s -> 81.02s]  Ah, onto where now we'll land
[81.02s -> 83.48s]  I'm waiting past dreaming
[83.48s -> 88.36s]  Too wanted to arrive and find it
[89.02s -> 90.92s]  Forgotten the dream and waiting
[91.07s -> 93.74s]  Until nobody's true worries
[93.74s -> 95.70s]  Deep in my head
[96.35s -> 99.12s]  Seems now that I can't fall
[99.12s -> 102.24s]  I am now through a present
[102.28s -> 104.92s]  And soon all life begins
[105.50s -> 108.67s]  You and me will be all around
[109.47s -> 110.40s]  And more almost
[110.96s -> 112.94s]  Don't utter what I'm waiting for
[113.57s -> 115.44s]  So please go on and talk about it
[115.44s -> 117.92s]  I'll be waiting right there to hear you
[135.38s -> 137.70s]  No one knows of this night
[138.50s -> 140.98s]  Nobody's here but me and you
[140.98s -> 146.24s]  The scenery I waited for now overlapping with our view
[146.24s -> 148.90s]  The present and beyond upon a summer sky
[148.90s -> 151.64s]  I touch and I'm within the firework I see
[151.64s -> 155.55s]  We're in the focal place where I hand on to trace my dream with you
[157.15s -> 158.40s]  We're looking up
[159.30s -> 160.67s]  into the skies above
[161.88s -> 163.66s]  Lit up and shining bright
[164.21s -> 166.58s]  Shit light up on your profile
[167.52s -> 168.36s]  Violent ass,
[168.94s -> 172.12s]  so us don't let us do the same thing that made us who it's too
[172.20s -> 172.64s]  Over,
[172.86s -> 175.24s]  you just have to go here right now and overlap
[175.88s -> 176.88s]  in real soon
[182.14s -> 182.74s]  Ah,
[182.74s -> 184.96s]  you're in our night with me,
[185.38s -> 187.54s]  just me and you dancing
[188.24s -> 191.43s]  For told that night we're from arriving
[192.12s -> 194.76s]  Find God through your mind will be
[195.00s -> 196.74s]  told Find God through be understood
[197.09s -> 202.82s]  And that seems the only dream to be reaching
[203.20s -> 208.88s]  And now through our presence And soon no one begins
[209.14s -> 213.78s]  And our days are in turn for we've met
[213.78s -> 216.94s]  More almost, don't utter what I'm waiting for
[216.96s -> 219.40s]  Almost look out, find a load of fireworks
[219.40s -> 221.64s]  Your world is now here, I've been over too
[222.38s -> 225.02s]  No doubt, no sound in this silence
[225.76s -> 227.36s]  You speak, I'm in love with you
