We now, see through the night into the quietness
And drive into the street, moving on with no destination
Sitting there to my left, I glance at you
The side of your face, the moon was shining its light
Just like searching around within our history
Like crawling carefully, combining words together one by one
I was feeling the overflowing thoughts
All visions leading to memories of time with you
I know, starting from the day, feeling was set
Deciding to live by your side
Steadily, gradually, all my world's been changing
Just to be stronger than I feel
And covering the weakness deep within
Into my days of pretending
Suddenly when you arrived into my life
I saw the look deep in your eyes
It taught me all that knowledge I had never knew before
When there is something to protect, that is the only thing I need
To be stronger now than I could ever be, I found
Moving in, moving in deeper into darkest of days
We would meet, and soon, together, spending our time
Luring in new days to be
Full of all the comfort
It was full of joy and pleasure
For you are the one that was saving my soul all along
Now I can see
Capturing a little fragment of a light
It shined a bit and soon revealed
Movement of falling drops of tears just like a shooting star
From a life of imperfection
It's pouring out and slowly falling down
Those beautiful drops of tears
Even all the tenderness hiding beneath that body
Large and powerful
Even in that face resembling pain and sorrow
I could see beauty, this, I've found
The figure isn't what it's all about
I finally have realized
Echoing into the night
Cold unforgiving sound of gunshot in the air
The fading breath evoking our goodbyes approaching soon
And shining for only an instant
A merciless shooting star I see
The wishes made upon it disappeared into the dark
In the palm of my hand, I felt it burning out
Color of the gold, a comet of sincere true kindness
Touching the gorgeous mane, so beautiful
Deep in the shadows, I held tightly within my hands
