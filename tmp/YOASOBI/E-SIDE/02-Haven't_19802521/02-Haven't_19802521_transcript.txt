[2.56s -> 3.00s]  Not enough,
[3.16s -> 6.43s]  no time you've got before I cry aloud
[7.12s -> 7.46s]  I
[8.02s -> 11.71s]  spent it up leaving not a tone and only old
[11.82s -> 13.52s]  No more signs of me
[17.26s -> 18.80s]  Say you're not around
[24.18s -> 25.89s]  It all began and all in one morning
[26.31s -> 28.30s]  I hear the beat as I make emotions
[30.00s -> 31.44s]  the space shared in our days
[32.14s -> 34.23s]  Lay out a seal my eyes upon their remnant
[34.36s -> 37.54s]  How do we know I brought it down?
[38.78s -> 39.74s]  What can I know?
[39.88s -> 44.25s]  Trying to say that but I haven't
[44.56s -> 47.10s]  That could I were not climb up and keep
[47.10s -> 50.08s]  fall Such a good heart and screep fall
[50.45s -> 55.68s]  Sayonara to go on We know where our back could wind up
[55.97s -> 58.08s]  It's a heart, who am I to get on?
[58.26s -> 60.66s]  You came to me, the small words you said
[60.72s -> 64.26s]  Falling out, I know the words, I run out
[74.82s -> 76.54s]  It all began on a warm morning
[76.58s -> 79.30s]  I never should somebody come to that
[79.80s -> 82.10s]  Inside of it, a home without will be lost
[82.10s -> 85.12s]  The commonalities around without you there
[85.68s -> 88.20s]  Why do we know you keep me down?
[89.50s -> 90.44s]  So that's it
[90.44s -> 94.20s]  I should blame my own past, yet I haven't
[95.78s -> 98.28s]  A little time you stick your love by a wish-o
[98.28s -> 100.92s]  So let us hide you ending all my time with you
[100.92s -> 101.88s]  We're going down,
[101.90s -> 102.08s]  down,
[102.14s -> 102.38s]  far,
[102.48s -> 103.42s]  we're letting it down,
[103.48s -> 103.58s]  oh
[103.58s -> 107.10s]  We're just another example of a new denarii story now
[107.44s -> 109.74s]  Upon a laugh you have that even shine
[110.38s -> 113.48s]  Seemingly so bright, all caught in was soot
[113.48s -> 114.92s]  Covered in dust
[116.18s -> 116.94s]  Bakura
[116.94s -> 118.10s]  We're not quite
[118.10s -> 119.20s]  Muppet people
[119.33s -> 121.08s]  Such a kind heart
[121.08s -> 122.04s]  And cripple
[122.04s -> 123.42s]  Sayonara
[123.42s -> 124.66s]  Need to go
[124.66s -> 125.84s]  Through these streets
[125.84s -> 127.55s]  So what is to end up
[128.00s -> 128.42s]  It's a heart
[128.42s -> 130.14s]  Who am I to get on
[130.14s -> 131.10s]  You came to me
[131.19s -> 132.26s]  It's too much
[132.54s -> 133.15s]  When actually
[133.36s -> 135.12s]  Words like these
[135.12s -> 136.22s]  Pour right out
[155.00s -> 156.98s]  Recomplication, how they got the heart to burn
[156.98s -> 159.34s]  It could have been a lot more hard if those
[159.34s -> 161.72s]  Can't forget all you will see
[161.72s -> 164.99s]  And end up walking just for giving up
[165.28s -> 166.76s]  When our affections start to leave
[166.76s -> 168.36s]  Behold, I rise and feel enough
[168.41s -> 169.92s]  Cloudy days of madness
[169.92s -> 173.44s]  Now we've got no more left to recover
[177.74s -> 180.80s]  But could I were not climb up and keep on
[180.80s -> 183.54s]  But could I were not climb up and keep on
[184.00s -> 185.79s]  Such a kind heart and grateful
[185.82s -> 188.74s]  Say you're not up to go on
[188.74s -> 190.72s]  We know we're out the clock
[190.85s -> 193.82s]  Find out, it's a heart who am I to keep on
[194.21s -> 195.08s]  You came to me,
[195.20s -> 197.84s]  there's more words you start pouring out
[197.84s -> 200.12s]  I know the world's around now
[201.02s -> 204.52s]  So let them all in, climb up and keep on
[205.26s -> 207.40s]  Such a kind heart and script, oh
[207.40s -> 212.94s]  If we can leave this heart of a goat to that day and turn around
[213.31s -> 215.46s]  Can't help but thanks, alright then
[215.80s -> 216.42s]  You came to me,
[216.54s -> 217.54s]  there was one too,
[217.76s -> 219.12s]  they're boring now
[219.12s -> 221.46s]  But never reach, I laughed out
[222.58s -> 226.48s]  Through cold breeze and a far-off sunrise
[254.74s -> 254.98s]  Thank you.
