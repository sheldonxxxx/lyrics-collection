[0.00s -> 0.10s]  Ah,
[1.26s -> 3.06s]  so wanna see, let's do another post
[3.06s -> 5.72s]  Goodbye, matcha city, overflow 11
[5.72s -> 9.86s]  Voices are pretending publications of a library night deception
[11.18s -> 12.29s]  I'm trying not to comment
[12.32s -> 14.30s]  Could I could I, a roman common fee
[14.30s -> 16.20s]  But brain in tune with stimulation
[16.20s -> 18.28s]  We awaken, inclinations
[18.28s -> 20.36s]  Don't know who's gonna go there today
[20.36s -> 23.64s]  I wonder if I kept trying
[23.93s -> 26.18s]  What can I, what can I be done?
[26.22s -> 28.98s]  On to the world, what can I, what can I be done?
[30.00s -> 31.72s]  Like little eyes, I decide
[31.72s -> 34.76s]  I need to love once, let your fear fall beneath
[34.76s -> 38.00s]  Ah, get out, you're fine, and I'll never let go
[38.00s -> 41.90s]  I'll write a future note to reach it even when the world is cold
[41.90s -> 44.03s]  And full of rocket beatin'
[44.36s -> 46.52s]  Yeah, to love and be free for once
[46.52s -> 48.70s]  No, I cannot be hurt in the world
[48.70s -> 50.90s]  I want it, I want it to be strong
[50.90s -> 52.32s]  That I won't get to reach it
[52.32s -> 54.74s]  I need to stay there, really
[62.90s -> 66.56s]  So what I see is to another tape Without a mask,
[66.58s -> 67.64s]  you never knew the dream
[67.64s -> 69.92s]  Of flowing in the city Feel the light,
[69.94s -> 70.54s]  feel the light
[70.54s -> 74.96s]  Release the turn of blind eyes Choking on the old hysteria
[74.96s -> 78.22s]  Matching with your innocence The proceed to our location
[78.22s -> 81.12s]  Echo with a sound of this keeping on Feeling high,
[81.18s -> 81.78s]  feeling high
[81.78s -> 85.56s]  Memories of a lasting flavor The other side's insanity
[91.02s -> 91.36s]  Ah
[96.92s -> 99.62s]  Can you call this something good or living at all?
[99.66s -> 102.44s]  And can nobody feel this sad and beat or living at all?
[102.52s -> 103.56s]  How is that true to that?
[103.70s -> 105.26s]  You can see I'm living at all
[105.26s -> 108.12s]  So let's imagine going no mistake or sleeping at all
[108.12s -> 110.88s]  And I don't wanna leave but you can see me saying it's right
[110.88s -> 112.76s]  And I officially believe in it,
[112.86s -> 113.68s]  just saying it's right
[113.68s -> 115.52s]  I don't know what I'll be and to believe,
[115.68s -> 116.34s]  yes I wonder
[116.52s -> 119.10s]  Won't you know the truth what I'm inside and under
[124.39s -> 125.86s]  Oh, spin me to death
[129.86s -> 132.80s]  Still we reside inside a dry,
[132.92s -> 134.06s]  confusing big world
[134.06s -> 137.14s]  I make a wish alone, believe it, I just wanna be
[137.14s -> 140.66s]  With you forever, give me hope to be
[140.66s -> 142.38s]  Just smiling with you again
[142.38s -> 144.83s]  Ah, this keeping feeling in my heart
[144.90s -> 147.40s]  It's shaking me within and begins to shout
[147.40s -> 149.88s]  Now you got to move, go make that way
[151.02s -> 153.62s]  I'm rewritin' through the fragile little myself
[153.62s -> 155.40s]  Go buy them to my own
[155.40s -> 157.68s]  Every jet even with the world is cold
[157.68s -> 160.56s]  And for love, rockin' me day and night
[160.56s -> 162.46s]  To love and be free, fall on snow
[162.46s -> 164.46s]  I cannot see nobody cry
[164.46s -> 166.62s]  I want it, I want it, to be strong
[166.62s -> 168.08s]  Gotta walk it to resume
[168.08s -> 171.04s]  I need to stay the real me
[181.18s -> 183.10s]  I'm gonna keep you from danger,
[183.26s -> 184.08s]  there are too many
[184.08s -> 186.84s]  I'm running, I'm running, I'm running for you
[186.84s -> 190.52s]  I will overcome what is residing for you
