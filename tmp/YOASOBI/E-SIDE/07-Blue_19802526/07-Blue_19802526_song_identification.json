  "reasoning": "The lyrics were retrieved from two reliable Japanese lyrics websites (uta-net.com and utaten.com), both of which provided identical English lyrics for YOASOBI's 'Blue'. The lyrics match the ASR transcript with high accuracy, including specific phrases like 'Ah, like every day I see' and 'There was a world of blue shining in front of me'. Minor variations exist (e.g., 'shown' vs 'shining'), but these are common transcription differences. The song is confirmed to be the English version of 'Gunjou', originally in Japanese but released in English as part of the E-SIDE album. Both sources credit Konnie Aoki as the translator.",
  "lyrics_content": "Ah, like every day I see\nAnother day repeats, I'm yawning all the time\nAfter all the cheers, the night, it fades out and\nShibuya receives a pour of the morning light\nAnd somehow, an emptiness surrounds\nThat's what I always feel\nSomething is not enough\nThat's how it's gonna be\nIt's all a part of life\nI'll let this be\nSee what, see what, covered deep inside\nLet us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on\nPretending won't bring it out of sight\nIt is always waiting there for you\nCalling followed, what I feel's to be drawn\nGoing by my selection in this color, then\nSuddenly, with the breeze of a drowsy morning\nThere was a world of blue shown in front of me\nLiking what you believe in and saying that you do\nCan be too terrifying, but I know\nI've finally come across a true discovery of what I got\nAh, the more that I reach out my hands to what I need\nThe further it becomes\nAnother one of these unruly days go on\nI'm always in a hurry as I'm struggling\nMisery, stemming from all my thoughts\nHumiliation brings new tears into my view\nThe more that I step in, the harder it becomes\nEven the pain renews\nCalling followed, what I feel is the move\nGoing by my selection in this path I walk\nOn a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy\nI'm grabbing tight, the blue vow in front of me\nTaking what you believe and to keep doing so\nEvery step's not only fun all the time\nDon't know if I'm able, cause I am worried a little\nAh, “one line” was drawn\nEvery “one line” was drawn\nMissing inner confidence, I've drawn all pages I could draw\nAh, “one time” becomes\nEvery “one time” becomes\nSoon, a large accumulation of a strength inside of you\nAll around, I look at them\nComparing what I do with them\nWhat is it only I can do that nobody else can？\nEven if I've got no true confidence, I'm moving on\nCovered in thoughts and emotion within\nUnknown to me, a brand new feeling\nAnd, on the day I took the step for the first time\nIncluding even this, new pain that I felt too\nLiking what you believe in and facing it led\nTo a touch of the preview of a light\nGonna be alright, let us go\nAll I can do now is to have the fun\nEverything is on the line as I draw\nUsing my own unique usage of colors and\nEvery dawn, every night, I would keep on running\nAnd now I found the blue glowing light on me\nLiking what you believe in and facing it too\nCan be still terrifying but now I know\nNo longer am I these versions of me living in transparency\nNow I know how to be my precious incomparable new self\nSee what, see what, covered deep inside\nLet us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on\nPretending won't bring it out of sight\nIt is always waiting there, still always waiting there for you and\nSee what, see what, covered deep inside\nLet us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on\nPretending won't bring it out of sight\nIt is always waiting there, waiting inside of you",
