Ah, like every day I see
Another day repeats, I'm yawning all the time
After all the cheers, the night, it fades out and
Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light
And somehow, an emptiness surrounds
That's what I always feel
Something is not enough
That's how it's gonna be
It's all a part of life
I'll let this be
See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won't bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there for you
Calling followed, what I feel's to be drawn
Going by my selection in this color, then
Suddenly, with the breeze of a drowsy morning
There was a world of blue shown in front of me
Liking what you believe in and saying that you do
Can be too terrifying, but I know
I've finally come across a true discovery of what I got
Ah, the more that I reach out my hands to what I need
The further it becomes
Another one of these unruly days go on
I'm always in a hurry as I'm struggling
Misery, stemming from all my thoughts
Humiliation brings new tears into my view
The more that I step in, the harder it becomes
Even the pain renews
Calling followed, what I feel is the move
Going by my selection in this path I walk
On a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy
I'm grabbing tight, the blue vow in front of me
Taking what you believe and to keep doing so
Every step's not only fun all the time
Don't know if I'm able, cause I am worried a little
Ah, “one line” was drawn
Every “one line” was drawn
Missing inner confidence, I've drawn all pages I could draw
Ah, “one time” becomes
Every “one time” becomes
Soon, a large accumulation of a strength inside of you
All around, I look at them
Comparing what I do with them
What is it only I can do that nobody else can？
Even if I've got no true confidence, I'm moving on
Covered in thoughts and emotion within
Unknown to me, a brand new feeling
And, on the day I took the step for the first time
Including even this, new pain that I felt too
Liking what you believe in and facing it led
To a touch of the preview of a light
Gonna be alright, let us go
All I can do now is to have the fun
Everything is on the line as I draw
Using my own unique usage of colors and
Every dawn, every night, I would keep on running
And now I found the blue glowing light on me
Liking what you believe in and facing it too
Can be still terrifying but now I know
No longer am I these versions of me living in transparency
Now I know how to be my precious incomparable new self
See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won't bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there, still always waiting there for you and
See what, see what, covered deep inside
Let us hear the voice in you, and resonate in you, hold on
Pretending won't bring it out of sight
It is always waiting there, waiting inside of you
