As you are now thinking of that star, so remote
You're dozing off to be sleeping through with a thought
And the future you decide
The way you want to stride
Wherever you choose to set off, to go
Together, I'll be there by you
You hold old memories, asleep in you
You then were taken afar
So young, to this star
Deep inside, the growing wish
Held it tight
Over there, a scenery that's glittering
If you could only jump, and land in the globe you sight
It's only you, so lonely in this domain
Invoke and desire
Dream and hope you're drawing
As you see the future
And if you choose to keep on marching on
Instead of running off
And cleared of any doubt
Not to be part of those images someone paints
Not advancing in that show, chosen by someone else
You and I, ally to write our story
Will never let you be lone and be gone from your side
Hidden out in your chest, and the day will come
When your blade will be cutting all those chains
Unbound restraints
At all times, together we'll be fighting on
Brought up in this predetermined fate
Go ahead and crush it
Breaking free, we never were some puppets to start with
See, your realm ignites now
Your future to shine bright
Unbound possibilities, make it what you want to
As to scoot, holing up as you ran up to me
So, you climbed up in the cockpit and stayed inside
That kid in scenes left in the past, no more to cry
Before I realized, you grew to be powerful
It's your life, your story, your way
And it's not owned by anybody
And it has no answer that is right
Up to you to walk the route you point at
Now the spell is broken
And as we're now about to part with that fiction, defined
It's time to fly out to take off right now
At a pace no one can attain, I speed away
Kicking up the ground, soaring up the sky with you
Covering the future, that curse to grip tight
As you are changing it by using your own might
And by choosing not to run off, but to stride on
You extended the scope of all things you can reach out for
Grow to become so powerful
And on this planet, you were made to be born
To keep on living in this world, as time is flowing on
And so, you'd love it all, so you would treasure it
May all blessings find their way to you, I'm wishing it
