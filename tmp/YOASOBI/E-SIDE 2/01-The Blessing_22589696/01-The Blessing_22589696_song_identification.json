  "reasoning": "The lyrics were retrieved from two reliable Japanese lyric websites (uta-net.com and utaten.com) that specialize in song lyrics. Both sources provided identical English lyrics, confirming accuracy. The lyrics match the ASR transcript with high fidelity, including specific phrases like 'As you are now thinking of that star, so remote', 'You're dozing off to be sleeping through with a thought', and 'May all blessings find their way to you, I'm wishing it'. Minor variations in transcription ('dowsing' vs 'dozing', 'living through' vs 'sleeping through') are common in ASR. The song is officially in English as confirmed by YOASOBI's E-SIDE 2 album which features English versions of their songs.",
  "lyrics_content": "As you are now thinking of that star, so remote\nYou're dozing off to be sleeping through with a thought\nAnd the future you decide\nThe way you want to stride\nWherever you choose to set off, to go\nTogether, I'll be there by you\nYou hold old memories, asleep in you\nYou then were taken afar\nSo young, to this star\nDeep inside, the growing wish\nHeld it tight\nOver there, a scenery that's glittering\nIf you could only jump, and land in the globe you sight\nIt's only you, so lonely in this domain\nInvoke and desire\nDream and hope you're drawing\nAs you see the future\nAnd if you choose to keep on marching on\nInstead of running off\nAnd cleared of any doubt\nNot to be part of those images someone paints\nNot advancing in that show, chosen by someone else\nYou and I, ally to write our story\nWill never let you be lone and be gone from your side\nHidden out in your chest, and the day will come\nWhen your blade will be cutting all those chains\nUnbound restraints\nAt all times, together we'll be fighting on\nBrought up in this predetermined fate\nGo ahead and crush it\nBreaking free, we never were some puppets to start with\nSee, your realm ignites now\nYour future to shine bright\nUnbound possibilities, make it what you want to\nAs to scoot, holing up as you ran up to me\nSo, you climbed up in the cockpit and stayed inside\nThat kid in scenes left in the past, no more to cry\nBefore I realized, you grew to be powerful\nIt's your life, your story, your way\nAnd it's not owned by anybody\nAnd it has no answer that is right\nUp to you to walk the route you point at\nNow the spell is broken\nAnd as we're now about to part with that fiction, defined\nIt's time to fly out to take off right now\nAt a pace no one can attain, I speed away\nKicking up the ground, soaring up the sky with you\nCovering the future, that curse to grip tight\nAs you are changing it by using your own might\nAnd by choosing not to run off, but to stride on\nYou extended the scope of all things you can reach out for\nGrow to become so powerful\nAnd on this planet, you were made to be born\nTo keep on living in this world, as time is flowing on\nAnd so, you'd love it all, so you would treasure it\nMay all blessings find their way to you, I'm wishing it",
