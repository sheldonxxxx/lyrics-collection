  "lyrics_content": "To see how that moon is shining beauty\nWhile I’m all by myself, surrounded by trees\nOn the edge of departure, to be starting my journey\nUp to that day, reliving’s came across my view\nFew riches that we had\nHowever, all this kindness stood by me\nMy mother’s own\nThat sketching I was drawing and painted on\nI love it, she voiced, it was caring that was shown\nSo we could make a living\nShe gave her dream away, went to work instead\nAnd even so, to come the day we parted\nThen we came to meet and in such a time\nFalling for you, I learned of real love.\nSee, I was feeling that joy was bound to be\nSo, state, why’s it that all I’m treasuring has been fading to end\nIn a cruel realm of gathering woes？\nI convey byes to all.\nI need to go and meet up with you straight away\nProceeding up to where you now remain\nHeart is with you, forgive me\nAll at once, I heard your voice\nAnd it caught me off guard\nSo, acting to end everything in that style\nWish to be departed and gone\nCan’t anymore encounter people, as you know\nOn nights full moon is seen.\nAnd I could not reach for that side\nI fell, to end up on the ground, it’s been surprising\nThe moon chatted with me\nAt that very time, gave me a mystifying talent\nPowers crept out.\nI pour life into things I see and draw\nAs I distribute with this power\nEven all the dying greenery\nRestoring all the essence, too.\nAnd I could give it this time that I hold, and I’m left to live.\nI spread it to all the life I was then drawing\nSmall pieces, I divided it into\nThen I found a meaning to my life\nSo was everything when I got to meet you\nResembling me\nYou have been, over the days, living in the woes\nAnd when I tried to leave before and end it on my own\nGot mad at me for it all\nIn the bat of an eye, I was mesmerized.\nBut I know you already have somebody who’s so dear to you\nHe went on and betrayed you, and you know it’s wrong\nAnd even so, to reside inside you, love for him to flow\nSo, now, he’s on the way to a fade-out\nLife to lose all hues.\nYou kept on crying, and it was his name you called\nIt took that sight of you to make me realize\nAmid a single day\nSo, committed all the soul to drawing\nTo pour in my life in what I sketched out\nAnd from there, he was restored, opening eyes.\nI made it happen, it’s a miracle painted\nAs you were shedding tears\nComing from you blissfully\nSparing no trial\nWant to have you knowing my thought\nFinally, listen\nIn that way, giving me the joy to live my life again\nI will tell you, I so truly had love for you deep inside\nSee you, goodbye.\nIn the end, it’s just me\nAs I’m picturing you, my mom is in my thoughts\nWas thinking of you, and slowly closing my eyes\nEnd of the line of such a long journey\nFinally united again",
