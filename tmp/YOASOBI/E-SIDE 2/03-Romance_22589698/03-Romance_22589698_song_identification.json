  "reasoning": "The song 'Romance' by YOASOBI is an English-language track from their E-SIDE 2 album. Three reliable Japanese lyrics websites (uta-net.com, utaten.com, j-lyric.net) provided identical English lyrics that closely match the ASR transcript. Minor discrepancies in the transcript (e.g., 'happening so suddenly there was' vs 'Happening so suddenly, there it was') are due to speech recognition variations. The consistent lyrics across multiple authoritative sources confirm accuracy. The lyrics were originally written in English by Ayase with translation assistance from Konnie Aoki.",
  "lyrics_content": "Happening so suddenly, there it was\nAn incident that caught me off guard\nWhat started out with a note sent to me\nThough out of reach, back in distant generations\nCame from you to me\nSo hard to conceive this type of meeting\nNow you can find in my era, convenient new items\nHere's the way we live, unknown to you\nPouring in characters while interchanging these feelings\nUnaware, a blossom of romance grew\nIn no way can we ever meet up in real life\nYou and I evolve, away, in domains apart\nSewing up rows and lines, stacks of hues of feelings\nProfile not even known, indefinite for now\nDon't mind conditions, expecting all of your words\nWaiting goes on, I can't stand that\nIt is true, our times differ\nBut we go far beyond all limitations on our way\nMe and you, me and you, are sending out our feelings\nIf my wish is coming true, I vow\nOne glance is all I need\nI want to meet you now\nI love you, that's why\nUnforeseen thought\nI was reminded of what's in your time\nIn history recorded to befall\nOccurs tomorrow, cause of all tears to fall\nTo let you know it now\nSomehow, I'm in need of a miracle\nSo, time went on as it flowed\nPassing through all seasons\nAll your letters, no longer reaching me\nThose words that can't come to me, but only hurt inside\nPressure onto my chest ensues\nWhat is found down the line, from a hundred years ago\n\"See it with my own two eyes\"\nAs you hoped, imagining the future\nRoad that I'm now taking, and still walking on\nThe sore feeling, still holding on\nI keep it locked inside my heart\nSo, at last, holding it, your letter that came to me\nRecognizing, I'm reminded of those long-awaited conveying's\nThat I have, in my hands, for you went beyond that day\nThoughts you printed\nDesigned the last note of your love to me\nYou lived in your era, it's sure\nThe evidence of it all\nCrossing all generations, grasping it in my hands\nI gather all truth I can see, it's written onto this epoch\nIn time, I'll walk that way to let you know",
