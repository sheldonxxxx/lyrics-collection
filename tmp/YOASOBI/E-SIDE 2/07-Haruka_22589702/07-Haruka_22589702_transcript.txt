[13.90s -> 18.84s]  I know we're back when no one would think of me to take home
[18.84s -> 21.00s]  Had nowhere else to belong,
[21.34s -> 23.66s]  caught in and out and walk alone
[23.66s -> 26.10s]  You took a step while reaching out,
[26.24s -> 28.48s]  you shook my life and pulled me out
[30.00s -> 32.66s]  With your smile, I won't forget the look
[33.62s -> 35.50s]  Through life in every corner
[35.50s -> 37.80s]  Your moonlight players calling
[38.32s -> 41.24s]  Into this more, keep walking next to me
[41.24s -> 42.82s]  And soon taking on history
[43.26s -> 45.20s]  Though life can be sore
[45.20s -> 47.62s]  Wild light is seen a lot more
[47.62s -> 50.86s]  We share every bit of what those times
[51.30s -> 52.46s]  Are made of
[52.46s -> 55.28s]  Looking again ever the stories
[55.80s -> 57.70s]  Kept inside each
[57.70s -> 59.94s]  All memories come out overwhelmed
[60.34s -> 63.04s]  I share them with you
[63.04s -> 65.14s]  Away and alone
[65.76s -> 68.16s]  No one will see the step you take
[68.16s -> 70.06s]  And all that you've been through
[70.06s -> 72.40s]  For me to get to be
[72.40s -> 74.66s]  Here, right there, and so close
[74.66s -> 76.92s]  All that it would take
[76.92s -> 79.24s]  For me to be whole and delight
[79.52s -> 82.18s]  I stand here with you
[82.18s -> 84.48s]  Come in again with the words
[84.77s -> 86.98s]  I wanna say it's just
[87.70s -> 88.56s]  I am grateful
[97.16s -> 97.46s]  Oh,
[97.48s -> 100.46s]  so soon it was a joyous spring has come to us
[100.46s -> 102.78s]  A new departure, season three
[102.78s -> 105.14s]  A faraway new city move
[105.14s -> 107.66s]  You left me be with you once again
[108.00s -> 110.02s]  Went on a long and feeling deep
[110.02s -> 112.40s]  I'll be here so that you can see
[112.40s -> 114.30s]  I send it all en route
[114.30s -> 116.58s]  Because I'm always here for you
[117.70s -> 119.58s]  We see everything like a dream,
[119.60s -> 121.62s]  so it's not an easy journey
[122.01s -> 122.86s]  As you went,
[122.98s -> 125.36s]  heart to beat concealing all your tears
[125.36s -> 126.90s]  Still on we go,
[127.12s -> 128.99s]  everyday take a step at your pace
[129.16s -> 132.44s]  So you can become mature and walk on through
[132.44s -> 134.64s]  For me to get to be
[138.08s -> 139.72s]  Sitting here next to you
[142.02s -> 144.88s]  To me, if I can know your smile
[144.88s -> 147.38s]  If you show me your brighter days
[147.70s -> 149.78s]  I'll pray for every joy you get
[149.78s -> 151.01s]  Deep inside your heart
[151.10s -> 153.98s]  It's a friend within to be a part of what you'll be
[156.10s -> 160.48s]  Say, giving you so much is your own
[160.82s -> 164.50s]  I can understand plenty love around
[165.02s -> 166.27s]  you has bloomed
[166.78s -> 168.16s]  Don't cry that anymore
[169.28s -> 171.32s]  Remember now back in the day
[171.32s -> 174.62s]  How you would keep your face in smiles always
[175.55s -> 179.90s]  Always looking back as they read these views I follow
[179.90s -> 182.40s]  All memories come from within,
[182.72s -> 185.40s]  I share them with you
[185.41s -> 190.54s]  Away, alone, no one will see the step you take
[190.54s -> 193.58s]  Nor all the drops of tears you sow
[193.77s -> 199.16s]  But love becomes a new meaning to align with you
[199.16s -> 204.46s]  I could soon know that plenty true love got to bloom
[205.22s -> 209.32s]  Coming again with the words I wanna say is just
[209.32s -> 210.92s]  I am grateful
[211.82s -> 213.70s]  It's true, evermore
[214.46s -> 216.08s]  You will be okay
[216.08s -> 218.56s]  It's true, evermore
[219.65s -> 221.04s]  My love remains for you
[240.58s -> 241.98s]  Thank you.
