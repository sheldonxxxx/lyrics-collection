[7.71s -> 9.09s]  Don't know where we've disconnected
[9.72s -> 11.38s]  It's your first two reads
[11.38s -> 12.96s]  Now we go once again
[13.09s -> 14.88s]  But where we have split up
[15.42s -> 18.11s]  Even if many times we have been separated
[18.54s -> 21.40s]  You can see we're connected still
[27.80s -> 29.02s]  So goodbye,
[29.32s -> 30.30s]  farewell then,
[30.43s -> 31.78s]  we said the words divided
[31.78s -> 35.94s]  How many mornings and nights we've seen ever since that day
[35.94s -> 39.36s]  In our respective new future destinations
[39.42s -> 43.22s]  Extension of that day, today is what we need
[43.22s -> 46.96s]  With every moment that leads up to our meeting time
[46.96s -> 50.70s]  I can feel in my heart beating louder as the seconds pass
[51.40s -> 54.50s]  Look up at the sky that has green full of rain
[54.50s -> 57.34s]  It's more just like what we saw that day
[57.34s -> 60.10s]  Upon us was a seven-colored bridge
[60.10s -> 63.76s]  Here and now, we were able to meet once again
[63.76s -> 67.30s]  We have kept our connection alive all along
[67.56s -> 69.78s]  But since we talk about what we wanna speak about
[69.78s -> 72.22s]  I never end the overflowing out of soul
[72.43s -> 74.88s]  Hold up, this won't be lost, I mean what we know
[75.42s -> 78.66s]  We were lost by the seasons forever moving
[78.69s -> 82.50s]  Moving and beyond where the rules could be leading us to
[82.50s -> 83.87s]  No matter where we stand,
[83.97s -> 84.82s]  there's a plan as we want
[84.82s -> 87.18s]  We gotta tie our strings together like before
[87.18s -> 88.92s]  We'll meet again soon
[88.92s -> 89.06s]  Ah,
[89.96s -> 90.75s]  what was this?
[91.10s -> 92.61s]  And now we can know every reminiscence
[92.90s -> 94.86s]  And those recollections, retentions
[94.86s -> 96.28s]  We trust and we love, fill in these scenarios
[96.42s -> 98.34s]  We believe in the part of the composition
[98.34s -> 99.78s]  The first show to cut off
[99.78s -> 101.34s]  And we don't even need to worry about tomorrow
[101.34s -> 103.20s]  As if in a mess and then we're back to our past
[103.20s -> 104.24s]  In any case
[104.24s -> 107.58s]  Some changes that each of us have witnessed
[109.30s -> 111.50s]  There's been too much of them,
[111.50s -> 114.22s]  but we know Tell this thing
[114.22s -> 118.38s]  It's all about surprise That everything is still the same
[131.22s -> 134.18s]  When we look up at the sky,
[134.28s -> 136.08s]  notice it's turning white
[136.08s -> 139.76s]  We're exhausted and we see up on one side of our cheeks
[139.76s -> 143.50s]  A gentle touch and a stroke from that warm powder sun
[143.50s -> 146.36s]  It was just like what we saw that day
[146.36s -> 149.22s]  We return to our individual days
[149.22s -> 150.04s]  Hey,
[150.22s -> 153.86s]  every step that each of us have walked up to now
[153.86s -> 156.48s]  Has been us, every thought weighs feet on
[156.70s -> 161.38s]  But the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us
[161.44s -> 164.16s]  We've got to once again overlap now
[166.18s -> 169.68s]  Don't know where we lost connection within our stories
[169.68s -> 173.46s]  Once again, we return to our lives, step beyond
[173.66s -> 175.71s]  The things we talk about, we wanna speak about
[175.82s -> 178.16s]  The pages we'll still be filling up, you see
[178.16s -> 180.70s]  So now, let's keep on adding to the story
[181.34s -> 184.84s]  Even the setting red sun, we looked up at once
[184.84s -> 186.66s]  And the blue days of youth,
[186.76s -> 188.14s]  we have spent together
[188.30s -> 190.70s]  Our memories won't forget, never to fade away
[190.70s -> 192.66s]  I like the way the grace we always felt
[192.66s -> 194.71s]  We can meet again sometime
[196.08s -> 198.88s]  It's always dark with a white morning sunshine
[199.06s -> 202.02s]  Every time it's so, see ya tomorrow
