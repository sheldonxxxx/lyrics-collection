Don't know where we disconnected each of our stories
Now we go, once again, past where we have split off
Even if, many times, we have been separated, you can see
We're connected, still
So, goodbye, farewell then
We said the words, departed
How many morning suns have we seen ever since that day
In our respective new future destinations
Extension of that day
Today is when we meet
With every moment that leads up to our meeting time
I keep feeling my heart beating louder as the seconds pass
As I look up at the sky that has cleared from the rain
It was just like what we saw that day
Upon us was a seven-colored bridge
Here and now, we were able to meet once again
We have kept our connection alive all along
The things we talk about
We wanna speak about
Are never ending, overflowing out, and so
Hold up, this won't be loosening, for we know
We were rushed by the seasons, forever moving
And beyond where the roads could be leading us to
No matter where we stand
As often as we want
We gotta tie our strings together like before
We'll meet again soon
What was this？
And now, we cannot end the reminiscence
And those recollections, retentions
We trace and we laugh
Filling in sceneries we were living apart
The conversation offer a shortcut
And we don't even need to worry about tomorrow
As if in a machine, and we're back to our past
In any case
Some changes that each of us have witnessed
In total honesty, there's been too much of them
But we know, till this day
It's all of our surprise
That everything is still the same
When we look up at the sky, notice it's turning white
We're exhausted and we see upon one side of our cheeks
A gentle touch and a stroke from the warmth of the sun
It was just like what we saw that day
We return to our individual days
Hey, every step that each of us have walked up to now
Has been on separate pathways, we know
But the same morning sun is above and shining bright on us
We've got to, once again, overlap now
Don't know where we lost connection within our stories
Once again, we return to what lies there beyond
The things we talk about
We wanna speak about
The pages will soon be filling up, you'll see
So, now, let's keep on adding to the story
Even the setting red sun we looked up at once
And the blue days of youth we have spent together
Our memories won't forget
Never to fade away
And like the way the greens will always sprout
We can meet again some time
Our stories always start
With a white morning sunshine every time, and so
“See ya tomorrow”
